\section{Reference Implementation and Runtime}
\label{sec:implementation}

We sketch a prototype architecture: an interpreter core (SphereStore), modality transducer plugins, proof-carrying provenance logs, and a crystal economy module.

\subsection{Interpreter}
SphereStore holds spheres as content-addressed records.  The interpreter checks type and entropy budgets before applying rules.  Rule implementations are sandboxed WebAssembly modules.

\subsection{Modality transducers}
Transducers (e.g. TTS, ASR, summarizers) declare typed signatures and epsilon budgets.  Only \emph{permitted} transducers are installed by governance; each transducer provides a proof artifact describing deterministic behavior or probabilistic guarantees.

\subsection{Crystal economics}
We sketch mint/burn algorithms for Texture Crystals (TC) funding closure operations and staking-based quorum for merges.
