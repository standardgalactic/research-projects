            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>The Playcosm conceptualizes a single-shard universe where play—encompassing Barbie dolls, toy cars, and strategy games like Age of Empires—unifies disparate activities as simulations of institutional ecosystems. Governed by institutions as factories, farms, ecosystems, and object-oriented programs, the Playcosm restricts affordances through privilege gates, creating stratified simulations. This article argues that play trains predictive models of complex systems, critiques shallow gamification for lacking generative affordances, and posits toys as prefigurative platforms for technological evolution. Disengagement risks cognitive isolation, leaving players with static simulations unfit for the Playcosm’s dynamics. Drawing on cognitive science, institutional theory, and semiotics, the framework offers implications for designing equitable, simulation-rich ecosystems. (150 words)</p>

            <h4>1 Introduction</h4>
            <p>Human interaction with objects—dolls, toy cars, digital assets—is mediated by internal simulations that model their roles within institutional ecosystems. The Playcosm, a conceptual single-shard universe, unifies play activities (e.g., styling Barbie dolls, racing toy cars, managing Age of Empires empires) as simulations of these systems, distinguished only by affordance gates. Actions are shielded by privilege gates, institutional mechanisms restricting access based on roles, resources, or status, creating stratified simulations. This article argues that play trains predictive models of complex social and material systems, critiques shallow gamification for failing to replicate play’s generative logic, and posits that the Playcosm prefigures technological evolution through toy-mediated simulations. Disengagement risks cognitive isolation, leaving players with static simulations unfit for the Playcosm’s dynamics. Drawing on cognitive science (?), institutional theory (?), and semiotics (?), this framework explores unified play, privilege, and the Playcosm’s role as a forecasting engine.<sup>1</sup></p>

            <h4>2 The Playcosm: A Single-Shard Ecosystem</h4>
            <p>The Playcosm is a singular, interconnected universe where objects (dolls, vehicles, digital assets) and systems (roads, markets, empires) coexist in a shared ecosystem. Unlike multiplayer environments with separate servers, the Playcosm is a single shard, governed by institutions as hybrid systems: factories producing objects (toys, tools, game assets), farms cultivating behavioral patterns (play norms, game rules), ecosystems recycling feedback (user actions, system updates), and object-oriented programs (OOP) encapsulating complexity behind interfaces (e.g., styleDoll(), buildCity()). These institutions shape affordances, defining how players simulate interactions (?).</p>
            <p>A toy car is a node in a mobility ecosystem, governed by a “class” with methods like simulateJourney(). A Barbie doll is a prop in a social hierarchy, exposing enactRole().</p>
            <p><sup>1</sup>The Playcosm extends prior work on play as a cultural system (??), reframing it as a computational and institutional ontology.</p>

            <div class="page-break">--- PAGE 2 ---</div>

            <p>A city in Age of Empires runs manageResources(). These are unified forms of play, training players to model institutional ecosystems through varied affordances. The Playcosm’s single-shard nature ensures actions ripple across the ecosystem, but privilege gates shield these actions, fragmenting visibility and access.</p>

            <h4>3 Privilege Gates: Shielding Actions in the Playcosm</h4>
            <p>Privilege gates are institutional mechanisms—coded into the Playcosm’s “fields” (standards, rules) and “factories” (production, enforcement)—that restrict affordances based on player attributes: wealth, status, knowledge, or role. In OOP terms, gates are access modifiers (e.g., private, protected) that shield methods from unauthorized calls. A high-privilege player might access designRoad(), shaping infrastructure, while a low-privilege player is limited to navigateRoad(). A Barbie doll’s styling options might be gated by currency, shielding exclusive outfits. In Age of Empires, advanced tech trees might be locked behind premium accounts, hiding strategic affordances (?).</p>
            <p>Gates fragment the Playcosm’s single shard, creating stratified simulations. High-privilege players simulate broader ecosystems—designing cities, setting rules—while low-privilege players simulate narrower ones—following paths, using basic tools. Actions are shielded: a high-privilege player’s city-building is invisible until its effects (e.g., taxes, borders) manifest, mirroring real-world elites shaping markets or laws behind closed doors. Gates ensure the Playcosm is shared yet segregated, a unified universe with unequal interfaces.</p>

            <h4>4 Unified Play: Simulating the Gated Ecosystem</h4>
            <p>Cognitive science posits that humans rely on predictive processing, constructing internal models to anticipate outcomes (?). In the Playcosm, play is the primary mechanism for building these simulations. Pushing a toy car simulates mobility: Roll forward, avoid obstacles. Styling a Barbie doll simulates social roles: Outfit signals status. Managing a city in Age of Empires simulates governance: Allocate resources, expand. These activities are unified by their function: modeling institutional ecosystems. They differ only in affordances, the action possibilities shaped by institutional design (?).<sup>2</sup></p>

            <div class="page-break">--- PAGE 3 ---</div>

            <p>A toy car’s wheels afford rolling, embedding a simulation of traffic systems. A Barbie doll’s outfits afford styling, simulating social hierarchies. Age of Empires affords strategic planning, simulating resource management. The Sims affords narrative control, simulating domestic ecosystems. All train players to predict how objects or agents interact within rule-bound systems. Pushing a toy car is Age of Empires with tactile affordances; styling Barbie is The Sims with social affordances. The game is one: simulating the Playcosm’s gated dynamics (?).</p>

            <h4>5 Semiotic Grammar of Play: Affordances as Sign Language</h4>
            <p>Play is an embodied semiotic process, where objects teach a gestural syntax forming a simulation grammar (?). A toy car’s push encodes: move = travel. A Barbie doll’s outfit swap encodes: style = role. Clicking to build in Age of Empires encodes: command = grow. These gestures form a sign language, where actions carry meaning within the ecosystem, aligning with Polanyi’s (?) tacit knowledge: players master simulations before articulating rules (?).</p>
            <p>Institutions shape affordances via standards and production. Toy cars mimic real vehicles, embedding mobility simulations. Barbie dolls reflect cultural norms, encoding social roles. Strategy games formalize institutional logics—taxation, diplomacy—into mechanics. Privilege gates modulate affordances: a high-privilege player’s Barbie accesses exclusive styles, enriching their social simulation, while a low-privilege player’s options are constrained. The “fields” (design standards) and “factories” (toymakers, developers) ensure affordances align with the Playcosm’s logic, but gates determine who accesses which signs.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup>? describes digital games as affordance-driven narrative systems, a concept extended here to physical toys.</p>

            <div class="page-break">--- PAGE 4 ---</div>

            <h4>6 The Failure of Shallow Gamification: Metrics Without Metagame</h4>
            <p>The Playcosm’s emphasis on unified play highlights the shortcomings of shallow gamification in workplaces and marketing, which mimics games’ surface elements—points, badges, leaderboards—without their generative logic. These systems fail because they lack open-ended play’s core affordances: platform expansion, emergent goal structures, and strategic ambiguity, producing non-expanding shards that stifle simulation growth (?).</p>
            <p>Unlike sandbox or strategy games that dynamically recalibrate objectives and scale complexity (e.g., Age of Empires, Minecraft, Kerbal Space Program), gamified frameworks operate as closed loops. They instantiate static success criteria, often coupled to surveillance regimes (e.g., KPIs, productivity dashboards), rendering play a disciplinary tool rather than a simulation-expansion engine. Three key failures emerge:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Absence of Platform Escalation</strong>: Robust games provide escalating affordance planes—new units, abilities, social functions—as players master systems, reframing the simulation’s scope. Gamified workplaces rarely allow role expansion or rule renegotiation. Employees are locked into narrow recognition loops (e.g., badges for punctuality), with no access to system-level affordances (e.g., defineProtocol(), architectWorkflow()).</li>
                <li><strong>Static Metrics and Exploitable Loops</strong>: Persistent games evolve feedback structures to prevent metric exploitation (e.g., “cheesing” or “min-maxing”). They employ metric drift, hidden variables, or adaptive difficulty. Workplace gamification ossifies metrics, enabling employees to optimize behavior toward the metric (e.g., call volume) rather than the institutional function, exemplifying Goodhart’s Law (?).</li>
                <li><strong>No Meta-Level Renegotiation</strong>: Open games allow advanced players to form meta-games—speedruns, mods, self-imposed challenges. Effective play systems permit meta-level intervention: altering rules, inventing games. Gamified surveillance systems prevent this: metrics are fixed, roles frozen, feedback unidirectional.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="page-break">--- PAGE 5 ---</div>

            <p>In Playcosmic terms, shallow gamification creates non-expanding shards—sub-ecosystems lacking institutional feedback, privilege-gated system access, or simulation elasticity. They simulate control, not sovereignty, offering extrinsic signaling without intrinsic expansion, flattening simulations and stunting epistemic growth.</p>

            <h4>7 Prefigurative Simulation: Technological Evolution Within the Playcosm</h4>
            <p>Technological artifacts—airplanes, wheeled vehicles, automated tools—often predate their material feasibility by existing as simulations within the Playcosm. Long before functional implementation, these technologies emerge as toys, illustrations, speculative fiction, or ritual play—sites of constrained but conceptually generative simulation. These proto-artifacts evolve not through formal R&D but through iterative play affordances that scaffold cognitive models and sociotechnical imaginaries (?).</p>
            <p>The Playcosm functions as an epistemic incubator: a semiotic and procedural ecology where speculative technologies are rehearsed in reduced, symbolic forms. A wooden wheeled cart pushed by a child constitutes a bounded simulation of vehicular dynamics. A paper glider models aeronautic behavior. These simulations inform the gestural grammar of eventual real-world counterparts. Historical examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wheeled carts and rolling toys predated vehicular infrastructure, providing simulated interfaces for motion, friction, and momentum.</li>
                <li>Model airplanes and gliders existed decades before powered flight, offering low-cost environments to refine aerostability intuitions.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="page-break">--- PAGE 6 ---</div>

            <p>Such affordance-rich play objects allow users, especially children, to construct internal simulations of not-yet-real systems, cultivating procedural fluency before material instantiation. In OOP terms, these are pre-compilable affordances: runtime-infeasible functions in the cognitive and cultural codebase, awaiting hardware support. Flight and motion were “debugged” through play before physical execution.</p>
            <p>This dynamic reframes the Playcosm as a forecasting engine, not merely reflecting current systems but simulating future ontologies. Its “toy logic” enables iterative testing of imagined futures within symbolic rule sets. Play does not just mirror the world as it is; it models the world as it might become, making toys ideational seedbeds where epistemic scaffolds and technical imaginaries converge. The future often plays itself into being before it builds itself into reality (?).</p>

            <h4>8 Play and Privilege: Refining Simulations</h4>
            <p>Play refines simulations through feedback loops. A toy car hitting a wall teaches friction, updating mobility models. A Barbie outfit rejected by peers refines social simulations. Losing a city in Age of Empires sharpens resource predictions. These loops mirror the Playcosm’s ecosystem: player actions inform factories (toymakers, developers), which adapt affordances (new toys, patches). Privilege gates shape feedback: high-privilege players receive richer loops (e.g., designing rules), while low-privilege players get narrower ones (e.g., following rules) (?).</p>
            <p>Disengagement from play—avoiding dolls, cars, or games—halts these loops. Without tactile play, mobility simulations stagnate. Without social play, role models weaken. Without strategic play, systemic understanding atrophies. Such players become “home-bound,” cognitively isolated, their simulations unfit for the Playcosm’s gated affordances, like avatars stuck in a tutorial (?).</p>

            <div class="page-break">--- PAGE 7 ---</div>

            <h4>9 Implications: Designing the Playcosm</h4>
            <p>The Playcosm reframes institutional design as simulation engineering with privilege, play, and prefiguration as constraints. Effective institutions craft affordances fostering robust simulations: a toy car’s design should intuit mobility, a Barbie’s options should flex roles, a game’s mechanics should clarify logics. Privilege gates must balance strategic depth with equity: overly restrictive gates create unequal simulations, limiting low-privilege players’ agency. Shallow gamification must be avoided, as its non-expanding shards undermine play’s generative potential. Prefigurative toys should be prioritized, enabling players to simulate future systems and shape sociotechnical imaginaries (?).</p>
            <p>The unity of play suggests a universal principle: all objects and systems should afford simulation-building, regardless of privilege. A road’s signs should mimic a toy car’s clarity. A tool’s grip should evoke a doll’s intuitiveness. A bureaucracy’s interface should mirror a game’s transparency. By integrating open-ended play, balanced gates, and prefigurative affordances, institutions can design a Playcosm where all players engage the single shard’s dynamics and forecast its future.</p>

            <h4>10 Semantic Glossary</h4>
            <p>To clarify the Playcosm’s conceptual framework, key neologisms are defined:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-expanding shard</strong>: A sub-ecosystem lacking feedback, privilege-gated access, or simulation elasticity, typified by shallow gamification (e.g., static leaderboards).</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-compilable affordance</strong>: A play-mediated simulation of a not-yet-real system (e.g., toy gliders for flight), executable in cognitive or cultural space before material instantiation.</li>
                <li><strong>Simulation elasticity</strong>: The capacity of a play system to expand affordances, recalibrate goals, and support meta-level renegotiation, enabling adaptive simulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Homebound cognition</strong>: Cognitive isolation resulting from disengagement from play, characterized by static simulations unfit for dynamic ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="page-break">--- PAGE 8 ---</div>

            <h4>11 Conclusion</h4>
            <p>In the Playcosm, Barbie dolls, toy cars, Age of Empires, and The Sims are unified forms of play, simulating institutional ecosystems through varied affordances, with privilege gates shielding actions to create stratified simulations. Institutions, as factories, farms, ecosystems, and OOP systems, cultivate these simulations, while shallow gamification fails by simulating control without sovereignty. The Playcosm prefigures technological evolution through toy-mediated simulations, acting as a forecasting engine for future systems. Play refines models through feedback, enabling navigation of the gated shard. Disengagement risks cognitive isolation, leaving players with static simulations. By understanding play as ecosystem modeling, moderated by privilege and enriched by prefigurative affordances, institutions can design a Playcosm that empowers all players to master and shape the universe’s logic.</p>

            <h4>Sidebar: Signs You’re Locked Out of the Playcosm</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Affordance Blindness</strong>: Avoiding toys, tools, or games, claiming “I’m not into that,” signaling an untested simulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Gate Ignorance</strong>: Misreading privilege barriers, assuming equal affordance access, revealing a failure to model stratified systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Systemic Rage</strong>: Viewing gated institutions as chaos, not logic, indicating a weak simulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Static Play</strong>: Clinging to outdated play forms, unable to adapt to new gates or affordances, crashing in the Playcosm’s shard.</li>

        <div class="full-text">
            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>This note rigorously derives the core primitives, operators, and dynamics of the Spherepop calculus as a formal reconstruction of Jacques Ellul’s structural analysis in <em>The Technological Society</em> (1964). We proceed axiomatically from Ellul’s phenomenological observations, translating each into a mathematical object or relation within a merge algebra. The derivation yields spheres, pop operators, resistance vectors, anti-admissibility, and the possibility of non-flattening pops—without presupposing any prior formalism. The result is a minimal, self-contained calculus that preserves Ellul’s insights while enabling precise theorems on technological closure and escape.</p>

            <h4>1. Prelude: Ellul’s Structural Primitives</h4>
            <p>Ellul describes Technique as a <em>total ordering operator</em> over social reality, not a tool but an environment that selects for efficiency, autonomy, unity, universality, automatic propagation, and irreversibility. We extract six irreducible observations as axioms.</p>

            <h4>Ellul Observation [Autonomy]</h4>
            <p>Technique evolves by internal consistency, not human intention. No subject directs the next technical step.</p>

            <h4>Ellul Observation [Unity and Universality]</h4>
            <p>All domains amenable to rationalization are absorbed into a single interoperable system.</p>

            <h4>Ellul Observation [Automatic Selection]</h4>
            <p>The most efficient configuration displaces alternatives by competitive necessity, not choice.</p>

            <h4>Ellul Observation [Flattening]</h4>
            <p>Technique translates heterogeneous interiors into standardized interfaces; semantic density is discarded as unmergeable residue.</p>

            <h4>Ellul Observation [Irreversibility]</h4>
            <p>Once flattened, a domain cannot revert without losing operational viability.</p>

            <h4>Ellul Observation [Closure without Agency]</h4>
            <p>The system admits no external corrective; non-interoperable elements become irrelevant, not forbidden.</p>

            <h4>2. Core Objects: Spheres as Domains under Technique</h4>
            <p><strong>Derivation [From Unity and Universality]</strong> Every rationalizable domain is a bounded, self-contained unit absorbed by Technique.</p>
            <p><strong>Definition [Sphere]</strong> A <strong>sphere</strong> \( S \) is a triple \( (I, B, \Sigma) \), where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( I \): interior state (semantic, historical, embodied content),</li>
                <li>\( B \): boundary interface (standardized signals, protocols, metrics),</li>
                <li>\( \Sigma \): semantic mapping \( I \to B \) (possibly partial, lossy).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let \( \mathcal{S} \) be the collection of all spheres.</p>

            <h4>3. Merge Operator: Pop as Flattening Composition</h4>
            <p><strong>Derivation [From Flattening and Automatic Selection]</strong> Technique operates by merging domains into larger, lower-friction units, discarding unmergeable interior.</p>
            <p><strong>Definition [Pop Operator]</strong> The <strong>pop</strong> operator is a partial function</p>
            <p>\[
            \text{pop}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{S} \rightharpoonup \mathcal{S}
            \]</p>
            <p>such that \( \text{pop}(S_1, S_2) = M \) is defined only if there exists a merge \( M = (I_M, B_M, \Sigma_M) \) with:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>\( B_M \subseteq B_1 \cup B_2 \) (interface contraction),</li>
                <li>\( I_M \subseteq I_1 \cup I_2 \) (interior pruning),</li>
                <li>\( C_\text{friction}(M) < \min(C_\text{friction}(S_1), C_\text{friction}(S_2)) \),</li>
                <li>\( H_\text{boundary}(M) \leq H_\text{boundary}(S_1) + H_\text{boundary}(S_2) - \Delta \) (\( \Delta \geq 0 \): entropy dropout).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Otherwise, \( \text{pop}(S_1, S_2) = \text{undefined} \).</p>

            <h4>Axiom [Efficiency Dominance]</h4>
            <p>For any candidate merge \( M \), define</p>
            <p>\[
            \text{cost}(M) = C_\text{friction}(M) - \lambda H_\text{boundary}(M), \quad \lambda > 0.
            \]</p>
            <p>Pop selects \( \arg\min_M \text{cost}(M) \) subject to deployment threshold \( \tau \).</p>

            <h4>4. Dynamics: Pop Regime as Autonomous Evolution</h4>
            <p><strong>Derivation [From Autonomy and Closure without Agency]</strong> No central agent selects pops; evolution follows local adjacency and cost gradients.</p>
            <p><strong>Definition [Adjacency]</strong> A binary relation \( \text{adj} \subseteq \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{S} \) holds if \( S_i, S_j \) share interface tokens sufficient for merge candidacy.</p>
            <p><strong>Definition [Pop Regime]</strong> A <strong>pop regime</strong> \( \mathcal{R} = (\mathcal{S}, \text{adj}, C_\text{friction}, H_\text{boundary}, \lambda, \tau) \) governs iterative transformation:</p>
            <p>\[
            \mathcal{S}_{t+1} = \mathcal{S}_t \cup \left\{ \text{pop}(S_i, S_j) \mid (S_i, S_j) \in \text{adj}(\mathcal{S}_t), \text{cost} < \tau \right\} \setminus \{S_i, S_j\}.
            \]</p>
            <p>Unmerged spheres persist unless dominated.</p>

            <h4>Derivation [From Automatic Selection]</h4>
            <p>The fixed point</p>
            <p>\[
            \mathcal{T} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \text{pop}^n(\mathcal{S}_0)
            \]</p>
            <p>is the Technological Society: a pop-closure under \( \mathcal{R} \).</p>

            <h4>5. Resistance and Anti-Admissibility</h4>
            <p><strong>Derivation [From Irreversibility and Closure]</strong> Domains that resist pop remain outside \( \mathcal{T} \), but only if merge is undefined or cost-prohibitive.</p>
            <p><strong>Definition [Resistance Vector]</strong> A function \( \mathbf{r}: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}^k \) assigns resistance coordinates (structural, semantic, cryptographic, etc.) that increase \( C_\text{friction} \) or reduce adjacency.</p>
            <p><strong>Definition [Anti-Admissibility]</strong> A sphere \( S^\bot \) is <strong>anti-admissible</strong> w.r.t. \( \mathcal{R} \) if</p>
            <p>\[
            \forall T \in \mathcal{T}, \quad \text{pop}(S^\bot, T) = \text{undefined} \quad \text{or} \quad \text{cost} > B
            \]</p>
            <p>for any initiator budget \( B \).</p>

            <h4>6. Non-Flattening Pops: Beyond Ellul’s Closure</h4>
            <p><strong>Derivation [From Ellul’s Implicit Assumption]</strong> Ellul assumes all feasible pops flatten. We relax this.</p>
            <p><strong>Construction [Higher-Order Pop]</strong> Define \( \text{pop}^+ \) such that</p>
            <p>\[
            H_\text{boundary}(\text{pop}^+(S_1, S_2)) \geq H_\text{boundary}(S_1) + H_\text{boundary}(S_2) + \Delta, \quad \Delta > 0.
            \]</p>
            <p>Such operators enable supersession of \( \mathcal{T} \) via expressive recomposition.</p>

            <h4>7. Summary of Derivation</h4>
            <p>[Table of correspondences as in original]</p>
            <p>The Spherepop calculus is thus <strong>derived entirely</strong> from Ellul: a minimal merge algebra that formalizes Technique as iterative, agentless, flattening composition—while exposing levers (resistances, alternative operators) for rigorous analysis of closure and transcendence.</p>

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>We prove a sufficient-conditions theorem for anti-admissibility in the Spherepop calculus, focusing on spheres protected by composed ritual (temporal-embodied sequencing) and cryptographic (computational-hardness) resistances. Under a resource-bounded adversarial pop regime derived from Ellul's Technological Society, we establish that spheres exceeding minimal thresholds in ritual duration and cryptographic entropy render all merge attempts either undefined or cost-prohibitive with overwhelming probability. The proof proceeds via lower bounds on emulation time, brute-force complexity, and superadditive gating, yielding negligible success probability even against adaptive initiators.</p>

            <h4>Preliminaries and Model</h4>
            <p>We work within the Spherepop calculus derived from Ellul (see prior derivation). Key objects:</p>
            <p><strong>Definition [Sphere]</strong> A sphere \( S = (I, B, \Sigma) \) comprises interior \( I \), boundary interface \( B \), and semantic mapping \( \Sigma: I \to B \).</p>
            <p><strong>Definition [Pop Operator]</strong></p>
            <p>\[
            \text{pop}(S_1, S_2) = M \quad \text{iff} \quad C_\text{friction}(M) - \lambda H_\text{boundary}(M) < \tau
            \]</p>
            <p>and \( M \) is the minimal-cost merge; otherwise undefined.</p>

            <h4>Main Theorem</h4>
            <p><strong>Theorem [Anti-Admissibility via Ritual-Cryptographic Composition]</strong> Let \( S^\bot \) have ritual resistance \( d \geq d_0 = \lceil \log_{1/\delta} (t_\text{max} / c_\text{step}) \rceil \) and cryptographic entropy \( h \geq h_0 = \log_2 (q_\text{max} / c_\text{query}) + 1 \), with \( \delta \leq 1/2 \) and \( \lambda \leq 1 \). Then \( S^\bot \) is anti-admissible w.r.t. \( \mathcal{R} \): for any \( T \in \mathcal{T} \),</p>
            <p>\[
            \Pr[\text{pop}(S^\bot, T) \text{ succeeds}] \leq 2^{-|B|},
            \]</p>
            <p>negligible in initiator budget size \( |B| = \log(t_\text{max} q_\text{max}) \).</p>

            <h4>Proof</h4>
            <p>The proof has three phases: ritual lower bound, cryptographic lower bound, and superadditive composition.</p>

            <h4>Phase 1: Ritual Emulation Lower Bound</h4>
            <p><strong>Lemma [Ritual Time Complexity]</strong> Any emulation of the ritual sequence requires at least \( d \) sequential steps. With path dependence \( \delta \leq 1/2 \), the expected number of trials to avoid fatal perturbation is \( \geq (1/\delta)^d \).</p>

            <h4>Phase 2: Cryptographic Reconstruction Lower Bound</h4>
            <p><strong>Lemma [Key Recovery Complexity]</strong> Recovering \( k \) requires \( \Omega(2^h) \) non-adaptive computations or \( \Omega(2^{h/2}) \) adaptive queries (birthday bound).</p>

            <h4>Phase 3: Superadditive Gating and Probability Bound</h4>
            <p><strong>Lemma [Gated Cost]</strong> Total effective cost</p>
            <p>\[
            C_\text{eff} \geq \max\!\left( d \cdot (1/\delta)^d c_\text{step},\ 2^h c_\text{comp},\ 2^{h/2} q_\text{max} c_\text{query} \right).
            \]</p>

            <p><strong>Lemma [Boundary Entropy Penalty]</strong> Successful merge (if any) incurs</p>
            <p>\[
            H_\text{boundary}(M) \geq h + d \cdot \log(1/\delta),
            \]</p>
            <p>so</p>
            <p>\[
            -\lambda H_\text{boundary}(M) \leq -(h + d \log(1/\delta)).
            \]</p>
            <p>With \( \lambda \leq 1 \), cost increases by at least this amount, pushing above \( \tau \) if base friction is near threshold.</p>

            <p><strong>Completion of Theorem Proof.</strong> Combine lemmas: ... Joint success probability: exponential in \( h_\text{tacit} + d \).</p>

            <h4>Corollaries and Extensions</h4>
            <p><strong>Corollary</strong> For \( \delta = 0.1 \), \( d_0 \approx 1.8 \log_{10} t_\text{max} \); for \( h = 128 \), \( q_\text{max} \leq 2^{127} \). Practical anti-admissibility is achievable.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>The theorem rigorously proves that composed ritual-cryptographic resistances suffice for anti-admissibility, offering a formal escape from Ellul's technological closure within resource-bounded regimes.</p>

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>We integrate the Playcosm framework—a single-shard universe of unified play governed by privilege-gated affordances—with Ellul's Technological Society via the Spherepop calculus. Privilege gates are formalized as pop regimes that flatten simulations into stratified, efficiency-optimized shards. Shallow gamification emerges as a compressive pop operator discarding generative affordances. Conversely, prefigurative toys and open-ended play construct anti-admissible spheres: ritual-cryptographic resistances preserving simulation elasticity against technological closure. The synthesis yields a theorem: spheres with sufficient pre-compilable affordances and balanced privilege gates achieve anti-admissibility, enabling epistemic sovereignty and technological supersession.</p>

            <h4>1. Introduction: Unifying Play and Technique</h4>
            <p>The Playcosm conceptualizes play—Barbie dolls, toy cars, <em>Age of Empires</em>—as simulations within a single-shard institutional ecosystem, stratified by privilege gates. Ellul's Technological Society describes Technique as a flattening merge regime absorbing all domains into efficiency-compatible interfaces. Spherepop formalizes this as iterative pop operations pruning boundary entropy.</p>

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>Goodhart’s Law—``when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure''—is formalized in the Spherepop calculus as <em>boundary entropy collapse</em> under high-$\lambda$ pop regimes...</p>

            <h4>Goodhart's Law in Natural Language</h4>
            <p>Goodhart's Law (1975) states: any observed statistical regularity will collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes...</p>

            <h4>Spherepop Formalization</h4>
            <p><strong>Definition [Proxy-Dominated Pop Regime]</strong> A regime $\mathcal{R}_m = (\mathcal{S}, \text{adj}, C_m, H_\text{boundary}, \lambda_m, \tau)$ where:</p>
            <p>\[
            C_m(M) = |o - m(M)|, \quad \text{cost}(M) = C_m(M) - \lambda_m H_\text{boundary}(M).
            \]</p>

            <h4>Theorem [Goodhart Entropy Collapse]</h4>
            <p>In $\mathcal{R}_m$ with $\lambda_m \to \infty$, the Technological Society $\mathcal{T}_m$ satisfies:</p>
            <p>\[
            \forall T \in \mathcal{T}_m, \quad H_\text{boundary}(T) \leq \epsilon, \quad |o - m(T)| \leq \delta,

            <p>for arbitrary $\epsilon, \delta > 0$. Institutional semantics dropout; only $m$-signal survives.</p>

            <h4>Proof</h4>
            <p>Let $S$ have objective $o(S)$, proxy $m(S)$... Iterating, all spheres converge to $m$-optimizers. Since $m$ is low-dimensional, $H_\text{boundary} \to 0$.</p>

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>Prefigurative play, as articulated in the Playcosm framework, is formalized in the Spherepop calculus as <em>pre-compilable affordance spheres</em>...</p>

            <h4>Prefigurative Play: Phenomenological Core</h4>
            <p>In the Playcosm, prefigurative play enacts simulations of future technologies—wooden carts modeling vehicular dynamics, paper gliders refining aerostability—predating material feasibility. These proto-artifacts evolve through iterative affordances, not formal R&D, functioning as an epistemic incubator where speculative systems are ``debugged'' in symbolic forms.</p>

            <h4>Spherepop Formalization</h4>
            <p><strong>Definition [Pre-Compilable Affordance Sphere]</strong> A <strong>prefigurative sphere</strong> $S^\text{pref} = (I^\text{fut}, B^\text{play}, \Sigma^\text{pre})$ where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$I^\text{fut}$: future interior ontology (e.g., flight physics),</li>
                <li>$B^\text{play}$: gestural interface (e.g., push-glide-crash),</li>
                <li>$\Sigma^\text{pre}: I^\text{fut} \to B^\text{play}$: partial homomorphism (lossy, anticipatory).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Theorem [Prefigurative Anti-Admissibility]</h4>
            <p>Let $S^\text{pref}$ satisfy $d \geq d_0 = \lceil \log_{1/\delta} (t_\text{max}/c_\text{step}) \rceil$ (ritual gestures) and $h_\text{tacit} \geq h_0 = \log_2 (q_\text{max}/c_\text{query}) + 1$, with path dependence $\delta \leq 1/2$. Then $S^\text{pref}$ is anti-admissible w.r.t. $\mathcal{R}$:</p>
            <p>\[
            \Pr[\text{pop}(S^\text{pref}, T) \text{ succeeds}] \leq 2^{-|B|}.
            \]</p>
            <p>Moreover, $S^\text{pref}$ admits $\text{pop}^+$:</p>
            <p>\[
            \dim(\text{pop}^+(S^\text{pref}, S')) > \dim(S^\text{pref}) + \dim(S').
            \]</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Prefigurative play is the <em>pre-compilable affordance sphere</em>: a ritual-tacit incubator resisting pop closure while bootstrapping future realities. Toys do not mirror the world—they <em>compile</em> it.</p>
