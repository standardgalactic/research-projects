Answer all of these questions:
A. Purpose of Memory
What does it mean for a memory to be "worth keeping"?
Should memory preserve only what is true, or also what was believed along the way?
When you look at a past idea, do you treat it as scaffolding or context?
Is the purpose of memory to finish a theory or to prevent losing ideas that might matter later?
B. Selection & Retention
What is a valid reason to permanently delete a memory?
Should all discarded ideas leave a trace of their existence, or be removed entirely?
Is an idea that has no formal expression yet worth storing?
Would you save a speculation you suspect is false but not yet disproven?
C. Structure of Knowledge
Should memory be structured like a dependency graph or like a conceptual web?
If two ideas are related but not formally connected, do you store the connection?
Are definitions more important than the stories that motivated them?
D. Time & Revision
Is the past primarily a source of constraints or a source of seeds?
Should memory privilege the latest formulation of a theory, or all formulations?
If a concept mutates over time, do you overwrite its prior forms or archive them?
Is forgetting a failure, or a mechanism?
E. On Failure
Should failed approaches be retained for lessons, or discarded to avoid distraction?
What is the smallest acceptable record of a failed idea that still has value?
Are failure cases more useful for future avoidance or future innovation?
F. On Theory-Building
Does a theory benefit more from:
remembering alternative formulations, or
remembering only the converged one?
Should the memory system prioritize derivability or discoverability?
Is mathematical elegance a stronger memory criterion than conceptual fertility?
G. On Context & Lineage
Is the intellectual ancestry of an idea part of its identity?
If a concept can be explained without mentioning its origin, should the origin still be stored?
Do names, people, and conceptual genealogies deserve memory space if they have no direct formal role?
H. On Retrieval
When recalling a memory, should the system return:
prerequisites, or
related ideas?
Is exploratory retrieval (serendipity) a feature or a failure mode?
Should memory retrieval ever return something adjacent but not requested if it might help?
I. On Compression
Is summarization a form of loss, or a form of refinement?
Should original detail always remain recoverable, even after compression?
Is it acceptable to keep a memory in a form that is not immediately actionable?
J. On Cosmology & RSVP specifically
Should RSVP memories prioritize:
conceptual lineage (SIT, UFTC-SF, TARTAN, Barenholtz, etc.), or
finalized operators and equations?
Does understanding the development of RSVP matter as much as being able to compute with it?
Should alternative cosmologies be stored within RSVP memory for contrast, or excluded for focus?
Is the history of a theoretical framework part of the theory or outside it?
K. On the Memory System Itself
Should a memory system optimize for:
future recall of ideas, or
future progress in formal construction?
What is worse: remembering too much, or forgetting something important?
Is completeness a strength, or a liability?
A. Purpose of Memory
A memory is "worth keeping" if it contributes to understanding, decision-making, or future innovation, either by providing evidence, context, or potential for recombination. This includes not only verified truths but also beliefs held along the way, as these reveal cognitive processes, biases, and evolutionary paths of thought, enhancing reflective analysis.
Past ideas should be treated as both scaffolding—temporary supports that can be dismantled once a structure is complete—and context, preserving the rationale for current positions. The purpose of memory encompasses both finishing a theory, by retaining convergent elements, and preventing loss of ideas that might matter later, ensuring resilience against incomplete foresight.
B. Selection & Retention
A valid reason to permanently delete a memory is when it is demonstrably redundant, harmful (e.g., promoting misinformation without corrective value), or consumes resources without foreseeable utility. Discarded ideas should leave a trace of their existence, such as a minimal log of rejection rationale, to maintain intellectual honesty and enable auditing of reasoning paths; complete removal risks erasing evidence of errors.
An idea without formal expression yet is worth storing if it exhibits intuitive promise or relational potential, as formalization often emerges iteratively. A speculation suspected to be false but not disproven should be saved with qualifiers, as it may serve as a boundary marker or inspire counterexamples upon further scrutiny.
C. Structure of Knowledge
Memory should be structured as a hybrid: a dependency graph for rigorous logical chains and a conceptual web for associative richness, allowing navigation by both precision and serendipity. Related ideas, even without formal connection, warrant stored links if the relation is substantive, as implicit associations drive creative synthesis.
Definitions are foundational but not superior to the stories that motivated them; the latter provide interpretive depth and guard against rigid misapplication, making both essential.
D. Time & Revision
The past serves primarily as a source of seeds—raw materials for novel growth—while also imposing constraints to ensure coherence. Memory should archive all formulations of a theory, with the latest privileged for active use but prior versions accessible to trace refinements and avoid cyclical errors.
When a concept mutates, prior forms must be archived rather than overwritten, preserving evolutionary integrity. Forgetting is a mechanism for efficiency and focus, not inherently a failure, provided it is deliberate and reversible where critical.
E. On Failure
Failed approaches should be retained for lessons, with distillation to key insights, to prevent distraction while capturing value. The smallest acceptable record is a concise annotation: the hypothesis, failure mode, and inferred lesson.
Failure cases are more useful for future innovation, as they expand the exploratory space, than mere avoidance, though both functions are served.
F. On Theory-Building
A theory benefits more from remembering alternative formulations, as these illuminate robustness and potential extensions, than from retaining only the converged one. The memory system should prioritize discoverability—facilitating unexpected connections—over derivability alone, though both are necessary.
Mathematical elegance is a strong criterion for retention due to its predictive power, but conceptual fertility—potential to generate new inquiries—takes precedence for long-term advancement.
G. On Context & Lineage
Intellectual ancestry is integral to an idea's identity, shaping its interpretation and boundaries. Even if a concept can be explained without its origin, the origin should be stored to enrich comprehension and credit contributions.
Names, people, and conceptual genealogies deserve memory space if they inform nuance or inspire, despite lacking direct formal role, as they humanize and contextualize abstract knowledge.
H. On Retrieval
Recall should return both prerequisites, for grounding, and related ideas, for breadth, with user control over emphasis. Exploratory retrieval enabling serendipity is a feature, enhancing creativity, not a failure mode.
Memory retrieval may return adjacent items if they demonstrably aid the query, with transparency to maintain trust.
I. On Compression
Summarization is a form of refinement, distilling essence while accepting controlled loss of nuance. Original detail must remain recoverable post-compression to permit verification and deeper dives.
It is acceptable to retain memories in non-immediately actionable forms, such as raw notes, if they hold latent potential activated by future contexts.
J. On Cosmology & RSVP Specifically
RSVP memories should prioritize finalized operators and equations for operational efficacy, while retaining conceptual lineage (SIT, UFTC-SF, TARTAN, Barenholtz, etc.) as annotated metadata to inform extensions. Understanding RSVP's development is as critical as computation, as it equips users to adapt the framework.
Alternative cosmologies should be stored within RSVP memory for contrast, in a segregated module, to sharpen boundaries and inspire hybrids, rather than excluded. The history of a theoretical framework is part of the theory, providing its interpretive scaffold.
K. On the Memory System Itself
A memory system should optimize for future progress in formal construction, using recall as a means rather than an end. Forgetting something important is worse than remembering too much, as the latter can be managed through filtering, while the former incurs irrecoverable opportunity costs.
Completeness is a strength when paired with intelligent indexing and pruning, mitigating liability in resource-constrained environments.
