# Future Directions (Stage 1 -> Stage 2)

- Port Lean skeleton to full Lean 4 with mathlib-style tactics.
- Implement modality-specific metrics (text edit distance, embedding distances).
- Develop mediation search algorithms for reconciliation (A*, heuristics).
- Design crystal economics: formalize mint/burn invariants and stake-based merge quorum.
- Build reference Web UI for exploring sphere provenance graphs.
