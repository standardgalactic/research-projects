\section*{Unified Preface to the RSVP Manifold}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Unified Preface}

There are moments in intellectual history when the available conceptual machinery no longer suffices. We keep adding patches to old frameworks—renaming anomalies as parameters, renormalizing contradictions into constants, expanding models to fit the data they once claimed to predict. In physics, this produces scaffolds without grounding; in cognitive science, recursive theories of awareness that lean on metaphors they cannot justify; in the social world, systems that optimize only what they can instrument, generating pathologies they were never designed to notice.

The Relativistic Scalar–Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory begins as a refusal of this incrementalism. It is not a modification of an expanding spacetime, not a variant of neural correlates of consciousness, not a warmed-over systems theory for society. It is instead an attempt to articulate a single ontology—simple enough to write down, rich enough to model the domains we have artificially separated: cosmology, cognition, meaning, value, and governance.

The premise is deliberately austere: the universe consists of three coupled fields—Φ, 𝒗, and S—whose interactions generate the phenomena we have historically attributed to expansion, gravitation, memory, agency, intention, institutional drift, and perceptual bias. These fields do not occupy space; they are the plenum from which spatial relations, causal flows, and semantic distinctions emerge. RSVP rejects the growth of space as an explanatory device and replaces it with gradient relaxation: structure arises not from initial vastness but from the inability of fine-grained uniformity to remain uniform under even the smallest perturbations. Entropy does not merely increase; it circulates, re-enters, smooths, sharpens, and maintains dynamic equilibrium across arbitrarily large timescales.

The seven articles that follow constitute a singular integration: a universe without expansion; a mind without substrate dualism; a society without extractive entropy gradients; and a mathematics that expresses these relations without excess metaphor. The reader may enter the manifold at any point. Together the seven articles do not merely describe a theory—they constitute the territory itself.

\section{Article I – Foundations: The Scalar–Vector–Entropy Universe}

\subsection*{Abstract}
This article establishes the fundamental physical framework of the RSVP theory: a non-expanding universe governed by three coupled fields—a scalar Φ, a vector flow 𝒗, and an entropy field S—whose nonlinear interactions generate gravitational binding, cosmic redshift, large-scale structure, and thermodynamic circulation without invoking metric expansion, inflation, or dark energy. The theory is derived from a single variational principle and yields falsifiable predictions distinguishable from ΛCDM.

\subsection*{Detailed Chapter Outline}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Introduction: The Case Against Expansion
\item The Scalar Field Φ and Gravitational Potential
\item Vector Flow 𝒗 and Negentropic Transport
\item Entropy Field S and Lamphrodyne Relaxation
\item The RSVP Lagrangian and Variational Derivation
\item Field Equations and Nonlinear Couplings
\item Emergent Redshift Without Expansion
\item Structure Formation from Fine-Grained Uniformity
\item Torsion, Vorticity, and Energy Re-Injection Mechanisms
\item Comparison to ΛCDM and Observational Discriminants
\item Simulation Framework and Numerical Stability
\item Open Problems and Forward Research Programme
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Mathematical Appendix}
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L} &= \tfrac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu\Phi)^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{v}\|^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu S)^2 
 - U(\Phi,S) - \lambda\,\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla\Phi - \mu\,\Phi S \\[1ex]
\partial_t S + \nabla\!\cdot\!(S\mathbf{v}) &= J_{\text{exchange}} \qquad \text{(entropy circulation)} \\[1ex]
\frac{d\nu}{dt} &= -\alpha\,\nabla S \cdot \hat{k} \qquad \text{(redshift drag)} \\[1ex]
\delta S = 0 \implies \delta\Phi = 0 \implies \delta\mathbf{v}=0 \quad &\text{only on a set of measure zero}
\end{align*}
Positivity of the Hamiltonian follows from convexity of $U(\Phi,S)$ and $\lambda,\mu>0$.

\section{Article II – Geometry: Categories, Networks, and BV Structures}

\subsection*{Abstract}
This article reformulates the RSVP plenum in categorical and geometric language. Fields become functors, flows become natural transformations, and entropy/negentropy exchange is governed by Batalin–Vilkovisky symplectic geometry on braided tensor networks (TARTAN lattices), providing a unified framework for physical law, logical coherence, and meaning transformation.

\subsection*{Detailed Chapter Outline}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Motivation: Why Category Theory for Physics?
\item Functor Fields and Categorical Potentials
\item Natural Transformations as Physical Flows
\item TARTAN Lattices and Braided Tensor Networks
\item Observer Fibrations and Internal Logic
\item BV Formalism for Entropy/Negentropy Exchange
\item Cohomology of the Plenum
\item Discontinuities, Obstructions, and Coherence Failures
\item Adjoint Time and Reversed Entropy Gradients
\item Applications to RSVP PDE Structure
\item Connections to Topos Theory and Higher Categories
\item Interpretation and Conceptual Summary
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Mathematical Appendix}
Base category: $\mathbf{C} = \operatorname{Sh}(\mathcal{F})$.  
TARTAN lattice isomorphism:
$$
\operatorname{TARTAN}(\Phi_1,\mathbf{v}_1,S_1) \otimes \operatorname{TARTAN}(\Phi_2,\mathbf{v}_2,S_2)
\cong \operatorname{TARTAN}(\Phi_1\star\Phi_2,\mathbf{v}_1\oplus\mathbf{v}_2,S_1\wedge S_2)
$$
Classical BV master equation: $(S_{\text{BV}})^2 = 0$.

\section{Article III – Mind: Consciousness, Agency, and Semantic Dynamics}

\subsection*{Abstract}
Consciousness is derived as a stable dynamical submanifold within the RSVP plenum. Agency arises from sparse variational inference (CLIO), qualia are geometric invariants, and meaning structures are attractors sustained by feedback among Φ, 𝒗, and S. The framework unifies predictive processing, integrated information, and active inference without substrate dualism.

\subsection*{Detailed Chapter Outline}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Why Consciousness Fits in RSVP
\item The Consciousness Manifold $(\Phi,S,|\mathbf{v}|)$
\item Sparse Bayesian Agency and the CLIO Algorithm
\item Semantic Entropy and Qualia as Geometric Invariants
\item Attractor Networks and Stable Meaning Structures
\item Observer Holography: Projection and Perceptual Bias
\item Temporal Adjoint and Memory as Reverse Flow
\item Cognitive Stability, Overload, and Collapse
\item RSVP-AI: Blueprint for Plenum-Based Artificial Intelligence
\item Comparisons to IIT, FEP, and Neural Field Theories
\item Empirical Predictions and Experimental Protocols
\item Philosophical Implications
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Mathematical Appendix}
Consciousness submanifold: $\mathcal{M}_c = \{(\Phi,\mathbf{v},S) : |\nabla_\perp S| < \epsilon_c \}$.  
CLIO update:
$$
x_{t+1} = x_t - \eta \nabla \mathcal{F}(x_t), \quad 
\mathcal{F} = \mathbb{E}[\Phi] + \operatorname{KL}(q\|p)
$$

\item Genesis and Philosophy of RSVP Labs
\item Technical Architecture and Retro-Computational Aesthetic
\item Scalar–Vector–Entropy PDE Laboratories

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Mathematical Appendix}
Core discretised simulation equations:
\begin{align*}
\Phi^{n+1} &= \Phi^n + \Delta t \left(\nabla^2\Phi - \lambda\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla\Phi - \mu S\right) \\
\mathbf{v}^{n+1} &= \mathbf{v}^n + \Delta t \left(-(\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{v} - \nabla\Phi\right) \\
S^{n+1} &= S^n + \Delta t \left(\nabla\!\cdot\!(S\mathbf{v}) + J_{\text{exchange}}\right)
\end{align*}

\section{Article V – Society: Spherepop, Infrastructure, and Entropy Economics}

\subsection*{Abstract}

Spherepop calculus and non-extractive design rules yield thermodynamically stable civic architectures.

\subsection*{Detailed Chapter Outline}

\item Technique, Entropy, and the Social Plenum
\item Spherepop Calculus: Domains, Pops, and Merges
\item Indoctrination, Drift, and Behavioural Capture
\item Semantic Extraction versus Negentropic Infrastructure

\item Economic Thermodynamics of Attention and Value
\item RSVP Principles for Social Equilibrium
\item Platform Rehabilitation Framework
\item Design Principles for Semantic Civilisations

$$
a \oplus a = a, \quad a \otimes \bot = \bot, \quad \operatorname{pop}(a,b) = a \otimes b^\ast
$$
