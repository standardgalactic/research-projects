Symplectic twist experiments in simulation reduced decoherence by approximately 12% under parameter sweep alpha in [0.1,0.3].
The original 2015 implementation lacked hardware support; there are partial logs indicating variance across runs.
What if we combine symplectic correction with learned decoders? This could enable a scale threshold for 1000-qubit error-corrected demonstrations.
