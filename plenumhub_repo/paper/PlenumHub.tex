\title{PlenumHub: A Formal Semantic Compute Substrate for Modular Knowledge Systems}

\begin{abstract}
Contemporary knowledge systems—social networks, version control, and machine learning repositories—optimize for exchange or prediction, but not for the structured evolution of meaning. Recent theoretical work argues that intelligence, artificial or collective, depends on recovering the latent symmetries and factorization structure of the world. Unified factored representation theory shows that gradient descent alone does not reliably discover these regularities, while open-ended evolutionary and curriculum-driven processes do, producing modular, interpretable, and transferable representations.

We introduce the \emph{Semantic Plenum} model, in which knowledge objects are multimodal spheres transformed by typed rule morphisms, composed through entropy-constrained merges, and completed under a Media-Quine closure principle ensuring cross-modal completeness. The paper formalizes mathematical requirements, operational semantics, and a proof-carrying runtime (PlenumHub) that enforces entropy budgets, equivariance, and interpretability invariants.
