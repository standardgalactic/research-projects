# Future Directions & Roadmap

This file summarizes near-term and medium-term tasks to expand PlenumHub into a publishable system and reproducible implementation.

1. Complete formal proofs (type safety, progress, entropy invariants) in Lean.
2. Implement full runtime with content-addressed Sphere Store (Merkle DAG).
3. Build modality transducer registry with allowed/permited models and signatures.
4. Integrate crystal economics runtime & staking contracts (prototype).
5. Conduct empirical evaluation: entropy traces, user study, benchmarks.

See paper/ for formal definitions and appendix for full algorithmic specs.
