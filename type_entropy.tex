\section{Type Theory and Entropy Effects}
\label{sec:type-theory}

We introduce a dependent type system tracking modality presence and entropy effects.  Types are modality signatures $T$; terms are spheres $\sigma:T$.  Effects are elements of a commutative monoid $(\mathcal{E},+,\mathbf{0})$ representing entropy budgets.

\subsection{Typing judgments}
A judgment $\Gamma\vdash\sigma:T\ ;\ e$ asserts that under context $\Gamma$ sphere $\sigma$ has type $T$ and entropy cost at most $e\in\mathcal{E}$.  Rule typing:
\[
\frac{\vdash r:a\overset{\epsilon}{\to} b}{\Gamma\vdash r : a\to b\ ;\ \epsilon}
\]
with composition of effects additive.

\subsection{Progress and preservation}
We state and prove a progress theorem (well-typed pops either reduce or are values/blocked only by missing modalities) and preservation (entropy budgets respected).  Proofs follow standard effect-system inductions adapted to our quantitative annotations; details in \Cref{sec:proofs}.
