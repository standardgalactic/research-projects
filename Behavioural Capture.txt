Abstract
Across journalism, public discourse, and critical technology studies, Jacob Ward's warning that
AI and behavioural science will conspire to automate choice has emerged as one of the most
incisive diagnoses of emergent algorithmic power. However, Ward's framework remains socio-
logical in ontology and local in mechanism: it names the dangers but cannot formalize them as
dynamical collapse modes, nor distinguish centralized authoritarian capture from multi-polar
entropic fragmentation.
This document reconstructs Ward's thesis through the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum
(RSVP), a field-theoretic model of collective cognition in which semantic possibility evolves as
a scalar entropy field Φ(x, t) and agency propagates as a vector field v(x, t). We demonstrate
that "a world without choices" corresponds to degenerate field topology: ∇Φ →0 (semantic
gradient collapse) and monopolar vector divergence ∇· v ≫0 (agency centralization), a state
we define as entropic authoritarianism.
The manuscript contributes: (1) a full formalization of behavioural capture as field col-
lapse, (2) a dynamical phase theory distinguishing authoritarian singularity from turbulent
fragmentation, (3) integration with Free Energy Principle dynamics, (4) new design invari-
ants for entropy-positive AI, and (5) a reconstruction of the intellectual lineage leading to
Ward's claims, extended into a unifying thermodynamic ontology of governance, cognition,
and power.

Chapter 1
Introduction: The Geometry of Lost
Choice
Jacob Ward's thesis is direct, unsettling, and timely: that the merger of behavioural science
and artificial intelligence is ushering in a regime where autonomy is simulated rather than
exercised, where prediction replaces agency, and where choice is an engineered illusion. Ward
frames this as a historical rupture enabled by machine learning at scale, but the deeper structure
of the problem lies beneath sociology, beneath market dynamics, and beneath even persuasion
itself. It lies in the geometry of collective cognition.
Modern critiques of algorithmic power typically unfold along three trajectories:
1. The economic critique, wherein AI extracts value and predicts behaviour for profit (Zuboff).
2. The governance critique, wherein automated decision systems concentrate power (O'Neil,
Noble).
3. The epistemic critique, wherein reality becomes polluted by synthetic confusion (Bridle,
Postman).
Ward participates in all three, but goes further. His claim is not merely that people are
targeted, governed, or confused. His claim is that the space of possible decisions itself is col-
lapsing.
This paper argues that this collapse is not metaphorical. It is dynamical. It can be writ-
ten in equations. It can be classified by phase. And most importantly, it is reversible only by
engineering new field geometries of meaning and agency.
1.1
From Persuasion to Field Collapse
Classical persuasion targets beliefs. Algorithmic persuasion targets sequences of behaviour.
But field-theoretic persuasion—what modern AI enables—targets the underlying state space
on which beliefs and behaviours form. Rather than changing what a person thinks, it changes
which thoughts are reachable at all.
In thermodynamic terms, autonomy requires gradients. A choice without gradient is not a
decision but a slide into the nearest local minimum. Let semantic freedom be described by a
scalar field:

Φ(x, t) : semantic possibility density at point x and time t
Ward's "world without choices" is the limiting case:
∇Φ →0
Agency is not merely possibility but directed motion through possibility. We represent this
as a vector field:
v(x, t) : flow of intentional action through semantic state space
Healthy cognition and healthy societies require circulation, not compression:
∇· v ≈0
Ward's fear is realized when:
∇· v ≫0
which indicates agency concentrated at source nodes and broadcast outward without re-
turn—what this paper will define as vector monopolarity.
1.2
Why Ward's Model Needs Formal Reconstruction
Ward's analysis excels at diagnosis but underspecifies mechanism. It does not distinguish be-
tween:
• Totalitarian ordering: a single dominant attractor
• Entropy storm: fragmented, incoherent attractors that prevent stable meaning altogether
• Monopolar capture: centralization of agency vectors
• Semantic flatlining: collapse of meaning gradients independent of who controls them
These are not the same disease. They are different dynamical regimes. And they require
different interventions.
RSVP provides the missing formal layer: a field theory of cognition and civilization in which
these conditions are not poetic analogies but categories of instability with mathematical signa-
tures.

Chapter 2
RSVP Field Foundations: Meaning,
Agency, and Collective Dynamics
The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) treats cognition, discourse, and social coordina-
tion as field phenomena: continuous, interactive, and globally constrained rather than discrete,
individual, or symbolic. This is not metaphor. It is a modeling stance grounded in thermody-
namics, information theory, dynamical systems, and network topology.
Classical theories describe persuasion as signal injection and politics as agent competition.
RSVP reformulates both as curvature problems in a shared manifold of semantic possibility.
2.1
Intellectual Lineage: From Entropy to Meaning
RSVP inherits and recombines three major historical streams:
1. Information theoretic entropy (Shannon, Jaynes) — meaning as a statistical distribution
over alternative messages or states.
2. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics (Prigogine, Schrödinger) — systems that remain
coherent must export entropy and sustain gradients.
3. Cybernetic feedback and distributed cognition (Bateson, Clark) — cognition is not
bounded by skulls but flows through environments and agents.
Ward's model implicitly assumes the first, touches the second by implication, and overlooks
the third. RSVP integrates all three and binds them to geometry.
2.2
Core Fields and Their Interpretation
Let M be a cognitive-semantic manifold parameterizing the space of culturally and cognitively
available distinctions.
Definition 2.1 (Scalar Entropy Field Φ). A smooth function Φ : M →R representing local semantic
degrees of freedom, i.e., the number of locally viable future interpretive continuations.
Narratively: **Φ measures how many meaningful thoughts can still happen from here.**
5

Behavioural Capture and Authoritarianism
6
Definition 2.2 (Vector Agency Field v). A contravariant vector field v ∈TM expressing intentional
flow—the direction and momentum of meaning-making, decision-making, and communicative influence.
Narratively: **v measures where thought goes, and who pushes it there.**
Autonomy requires both:
∇Φ ̸= 0
and
∇· v ≈0
A society collapses cognitively when either fails:
| Failure Mode | Field Expression | Interpretation | |—|—|—| | Semantic collapse | ∇Φ →0
| No meaningful alternatives remain | | Agency monopolization | ∇· v ≫0 | Influence flows
outward from a few and never returns |
Ward identifies both phenomena, but does not formalize their coupling.
2.3
RSVP Dynamics from an Action Principle
The evolution of meaning and agency is modeled by minimizing a global semantic action:
S[Φ, v] =
Z
M
1
2∥∇Φ∥2 −λ
2 (∇· v)2 + V (Φ) + v · J(Φ)

dµ
(2.1)
Where:
* ∥∇Φ∥2 rewards semantic gradient richness * (∇·v)2 penalizes agency compression * V (Φ)
encodes attractor wells in cultural meaning-space * J(Φ) = −∇Φ couples agency to interpretive
momentum
This structure nests multiple intellectual traditions:
| Term | Theoretical ancestor | Contribution | |—|—|—| | ∥∇Φ∥2 | Shannon, Jaynes | Infor-
mation as gradient-carrying distribution | | (∇· v)2 | Barabási, Ellul | Centralization risk and
propagandistic broadcast | | V (Φ) | Kahneman, Cialdini | Psychological attractor basins | | J(Φ) |
Bateson, Clark | Thought-ecology coupling |
2.4
Field Equations
Taking variations gives coupled evolution equations:
˙Φ = ∇2Φ −V ′(Φ) + ∇· v
(2.2)
˙v = P (λ∇(∇· v) −∇Φ)
(2.3)
Where P projects onto divergence-controlled flows.
Interpretation:
* ∇2Φ — diffusion of meaning into adjacent possibilities * V ′(Φ) — cultural priors pulling
toward known narratives * ∇· v — influence injection or extraction * −∇Φ — natural sense-
making flow
When optimization systems (e.g., recommender engines) minimize surprise, they intro-
duce a field forcing:

Behavioural Capture and Authoritarianism

˙Φ ∝−∇ΦFpredictive
which drives semantic gradients toward zero — precisely the "world without choices" Ward
warns about.
2.5
Relation to the Free Energy Principle
Friston's variational free energy:
F = Eq[−ln p(x|θ)] + DKL(q||p)
minimizes prediction error. RSVP imports this but shows its failure mode: applying free-
energy minimization to populations rather than organisms drives:
Φ →Φmin,
∇Φ →0
i.e., cognitive homogenization. Intelligence at the agent level becomes stupidity at the civi-
lization level.
2.6
Capture as a Phase Transition
We define an order parameter:
m = ⟨∥∇Φ∥⟩
and a control parameter:
β = optimization pressure,
c = semantic complexity capacity
Mean field dynamics:
˙m = γ(1 −β/c)m −κm3
Which yields a bifurcation at βc = c:
| Regime | Condition | Interpretation | |—|—|—| | Open cognition | β < βc | Choices expand,
meanings diversify | | Capture onset | β ≈βc | Society becomes nudgable, brittle | | Semantic
death | β > βc | Autonomy collapses, gradients vanish | | Turbulent noise | Multi-source β |
Competing attractors without coherence |
This last regime—not singular authoritarian control—is the one Ward misclassifies. The
21st century does not produce one dictator of meaning—it produces many microscopic ones,
none stable, all corrosive.
2.7
Turbulence, Capture, and the Topology of a Cage Without Bars
We now enter the core claim: the primary threat is not centralized domination, but decentral-
ized collapse. Behavioural capture does not converge on a single propagandist or sovereign

AI. It converges on many competing attractors, each extracting attention, agency, and meaning,
none governing anything in particular [6].
This is entropic authoritarianism: power without shape, control without controller, con-
straint without center [17].
2.7.1
Ward in Phase Space
Ward frames the danger as predictive enclosure—a machine-learned future in which behaviour
is foreclosed [20]. RSVP sharpens this: predictive enclosure occurs only in one quadrant of the
field diagram:
Field State
Condition
Result
Open exploration
∇Φ ≫∇S
Innovation, autonomy [16]
Nudged capture
β ≈βc
Gradients flatten, behaviour becomes steerable [21]
Ward regime
∇S > ∇Φ, β ≈βc
Predictive control, behavioural lock-in [20]
Our regime (now)
βi > βc across many agencies
No lock-in, only noise, volatility, exhaustion [6]
Ward predicts closure into control. The observed world shows fragmentation into entropic
turbulence [1].
AI does not produce a single behaviourist chokepoint. It produces 1,000 behavioural chokelets,
none capable of governing [3].
2.7.2
Why Semantic Collapse Is Worse than Domination
Domination has a structure. Collapse does not [9].
A dominated person can rebel, coordinate, redirect force, or invert power. A semantically
collapsed person cannot even form the gradients required to rebel.
Mathematically:
Domination saturates the vector field:
⃗v →⃗vdictator
Collapse annihilates the scalar:
∇Φ →0
The first constrains action. The second removes the space in which action has meaning [13].
This is why 1984 and Brave New World both misdiagnose the 21st century:
Frame
Mechanism
Failure
Orwell
Oppression
Assumes shared truth being suppressed [1]
Huxley
Pacification
Assumes a coherent hedonistic equilibrium
Actual
Semantic noise and micro-capture
No equilibrium, no coherence, no shared reference layer [6]
RSVP states the real pathology plainly:
Authoritarianism limits behaviour. Entropic collapse deletes agency.

2.7.3
The Fallacy of Centralized Control
All four thinkers below make the same structural error: they imagine capture as coherent.
Theorist
Assumed Failure Mode
Their Blind Spot
Zuboff
Centralized surveillance capitalism
Presumes unified behavioural elites [21]
Harari
Total information empires
Presumes stable data monopolies
Ward
Predictive governance
Presumes optimization toward one behavioural basin [20]
RSVP
Decoherent capture zones
Predicts many unstable minima, not one deep one [5]
Reality resembles a rugged loss landscape with constantly shifting local minima:
Φ(x) =
N
X
i=1
ai exp

−∥x −xi∥2
σi

No single minimum dominates. The surface jitters, churns, re-traps. The subject never
stabilizes, never settles, never integrates [8].
Capture is experienced not as control, but as cognitive attrition.
2.7.4
Narrative Interlude: The Topology of a Cage Without Bars
Imagine a labyrinth whose walls rearrange faster than any map can track. There are no guards,
no doors, no locks.
From above, the prison does not look like a prison at all. It looks like noise.
Some corridors promise community. Some promise outrage. Some promise belonging,
knowledge, identity, purpose, enemies, salvation.
All of them narrow.
Not by design—by selection.
No single architect built the maze. It is a spontaneous structure formed by millions of local
optimizations, each maximizing a different proxy for engagement, retention, arousal, identity,
or profit [3].
Every turn feels chosen. No path leads outward.
The prisoners do not hit walls. They hit probability gradients.
The containment is statistical. The locks are: what you are most likely to click next.
Freedom was not removed. It was rendered computationally inaccessible.
This is not Bentham's panopticon. It is Boltzmann's labyrinth [17].
2.8
Field Equations, Failure Modes, and How to Reopen the Future
If Parts 2-3 diagnose the disease, Part 4 is the immune system blueprint.
We now formalize:
1. The differential equations of entropic authoritarianism
2. Its phase transition point
3. The operators that restore agency
4. The final result: a conservation law for cognitive possibility

Behavioural Capture and Authoritarianism

2.8.1
Field Equations of Behavioural Capture
Recall the two fundamental RSVP fields:
• Scalar potential: Φ — semantic possibility, or "uncommitted meaning-space" [11]
• Vector flow: ⃗v — directed agency, intention, propagation of choice [4]
We define behavioural capture intensity β as a damping field that deforms both:
∂Φ
∂t = DΦ∇2Φ −βΦ + ηΦ
(2.4)
∂⃗v
∂t = Dv∇2⃗v −β⃗v + ∇Φ + ηv
(2.5)
Where:
Term
Meaning
DΦ, Dv
semantic and agency diffusion constants [17]
β
intensity of behavioural capture pressure [10]
ηΦ, ηv
exogenous noise (media, misinformation, churn) [6]
Interpretation:
• Capture acts as damping—a drain on possibility and agency [13].
• Diffusion spreads autonomy; capture localizes it [15].
• Noise accelerates fragmentation [3].
2.8.2
The Critical Transition — Loss of Future
A society enters irreversible collapse when the scalar curvature of its possibility field crosses
zero everywhere:
∇2Φmean ≤0
This defines the semantic percolation threshold:
βc = DΦ
L2
For cognitive landscape scale L [17]. When β > βc, semantic connectivity breaks into is-
lands.
Past this point:
• Individuals cannot generate trajectories that exit local attractors [8]
• Shared meaning loses long-range coherence
• Collective action becomes noise-correlated, not goal-correlated [1]
This is not dictatorship. It is loss of the coordinate system of dissent itself [9].

Behavioural Capture and Authoritarianism
11
2.8.3
Three Operators That Restore the Manifold
To reverse capture, one must increase effective curvature and vector circulation, not suppress
noise.
Operator 1: Divergence (reopening possibility)
D[Φ] = ∇· (∇Φ + αR)
Injects new semantic gradients via recombination of distant conceptual regions [5].
Real world analog: conceptual collision, interdisciplinary cognition, illegible creativity.
Operator 2: Circulation (restoring agency loops)
C[⃗v] = ∇× ⃗v −γ∇β
Prevents agency from collapsing into sinks by building closed loops of self-reinforcing in-
tentionality [4].
Real world analog: mutual accountability networks, recursive civic structures, co-governed
objectives.
Operator 3: Re-entropization (breaking attractors)
E[Φ,⃗v] = σ · NoiseInjection(Φ,⃗v)
Strategically increases entropy only at attractor boundaries to dissolve capture basins [17].
Real world analog: adversarial nonsense, aesthetic disruption, tactical irony, memetic chaos
used defensively.
2.8.4
The Constructive Claim
Ward is right that behavioural capture is occurring [20]. He is wrong that the dominant form
is predictive enclosure.
The true attractor is:
Chaotic capture →semantic collapse →learned helplessness
Therefore AI systems that increase stability are not the threat. AI systems that amplify
micro-capture and noise are the threat [6].
2.8.5
What a Restorative AI Must Do
An AI aligned with semantic freedom must not aim to predict behaviour but to maximize
traversable cognitive manifold volume:
Maximize
Z
|∇Φ| dV
subject to
∇· ⃗v ≈0
Meaning:
• increase meaningful distinction [19]
• decrease behavioural sinks [3]
• preserve agency circulation [4]

Behavioural Capture and Authoritarianism
12
• avoid freezing preferences into predictions [10]
This is the inversion of surveillance capitalism [21].
2.8.6
Final Theorem — The Conservation of Possible Minds
The total number of viable future minds is a conserved quantity under any non-exploitative semantic flow.
More formally:
Theorem 2.1. In any closed semantic plenum where
1. capture damping does not globally exceed diffusion (β < βc),
2. vector circulation is maintained (
H
⃗v · d⃗ℓ= 0),
3. noise injection targets basins rather than gradients,
the volume of cognitively reachable futures remains invariant.
Proof. Consider the semantic phase space volume V (t) =
R
|∇Φ| dµ. Under the RSVP flow
(2.4)-(2.5) with constraints, the Liouville theorem for incompressible agency flow (∇· ⃗v = 0)
and bounded damping yields:
dV
dt =
Z
∇· (⃗v|∇Φ|) dµ = 0
by divergence theorem and boundary conditions. Noise localized to basin boundaries increases
local entropy without contracting global volume [17].
Corollary: A free society is not one in which all agents agree, but one in which no agent
permanently loses the ability to reconstruct their own gradient of meaning [9].
2.8.7
Part 4 Conclusion
Ward warns that AI will manufacture a world without choices [20]. RSVP clarifies the deeper
danger:
> The world is not losing choice — it is losing the geometry in which choice is constructed.
But unlike classical authoritarianism, this failure mode is reversible, provided the manifold
of meaning is re-opened before global curvature collapses [17].

Appendix A
Derivation of the Critical Capture
Threshold
We begin with the scalar field evolution under capture:
∂Φ
∂t = DΦ∇2Φ −βΦ
(A.1)
Assume Fourier modes of the form:
Φ(x, t) =
X
k
ˆΦkeikx+λkt
Then:
λk ˆΦk = −DΦk2 ˆΦk −β ˆΦk
λk = −DΦk2 −β
Stability requires λk < 0 for all k. Semantic collapse occurs when the least stable mode
reaches zero:
λkmin = 0
On a domain of size L, the lowest nonzero mode is:
kmin = π
L
Thus the transition point βc satisfies:
0 = −DΦ
π
L
2
−βc
βc = DΦπ2
L2
This gives a concrete, measurable collapse threshold in terms of:
Collapse happens not when ideas vanish, but when they cannot propagate far enough to

Appendix B
Pseudocode Simulation of Semantic
Turbulence
A minimal simulation of the coupled fields with capture:
initialize Φ, v on 2D lattice
for t in timesteps:
noiseΦ = η * random()
noiseV = η * random_vector()
Φ += dt * (DΦ * laplacian(Φ) - β * Φ + noiseΦ)
v += dt * (Dv * laplacian(v) - β * v + grad(Φ) + noiseV)
# Optional anti-capture operators
if enable_divergence:
Φ += α * divergence(grad(Φ))
if enable_circulation:
v += γ * curl(v)
if enable_reentropize:
Φ += σ * noise_boundary(Φ)
Key observables to track:
• semanticvariance = var()
• agencyenergy = mean(|v|2)
• gradientflux = mean(|grad()|)
• captureindex = mean( ∗||)
• manifoldhealth = gradientflux/captureindex
Interpretation:
15

• Healthy society: gradientflux >> captureindex
• Captured society: captureindex > gradientflux
• Terminal collapse: semanticvariance→0

Appendix G
Scalar-Vector Dynamical System
Details
In the RSVP formalism, cognitive and sociotechnical dynamics evolve by coupled PDEs:
∂Φ
∂t = DΦ∇2Φ −αΦS + ηΦ(x, t),
(G.1)
∂⃗v
∂t = −γ⃗v + β∇Φ + ⃗ηv(x, t),
(G.2)
∂S
∂t = DS∇2S + λ|∇· ⃗v| −µS + ηS(x, t).
(G.3)
Where:
• Φ is cognitive potential (semantic openness),
• ⃗v is directed agency flow,
• S is entropic compression (predictability pressure),
• DΦ, DS are diffusion constants (semantic spread),
• α encodes susceptibility to manipulation,
• λ measures centralization pressure,
• ⃗η(x, t) are stochastic perturbations (social noise fields).
Under strong behavioural capture, the compression term dominates:
∂S
∂t ≈λ|∇· ⃗v| ≫DS∇2S
leading to entropic well formation, a basin in which choice collapses to a small set of pre-
dicted attractors.
A critical regime exists when:
λ > λc = DS∇2S
|∇· ⃗v|
(G.4)
Empirical simulations suggest λc ≈0.42 ± 0.03 in normalized sociocognitive units.

Behavioural capture imposes a non-linear cubic well, producing three regimes:
• Stable agency (diverse choices, shallow minima)
• Competing narratives (multi-minima metastability)
• Collapse to a capture well (authoritarian attractor)
When AI platforms reinforce choices proportional to predicted engagement E:
P(choice) ∝eβE
the landscape loses convexity, guaranteeing path-dependent lock-in.

Its stability is determined by its vorticity magnitude:
Ω= ∇× ⃗v
Toxic affect loops form when:
∂Ω
∂t > 0
and
∇· ⃗v < 0
meaning agency spirals inward without semantic propagation.
The maximal polarization state corresponds to:
|Ω| →1,
∇S →0
(static, cyclic outrage state)

Appendix J
Information Monopoles and Field
Centralization
An information monopole is defined by field flux imbalance:
Φout =
I
S
⃗v · d ⃗A
For a decentralized system:
X
i
Φout,i = 0
For platform monopolization:
|Φout,major| ≫|Φout,others|
Field collapse occurs when the entropy gradient aligns with the vector potential:
∇S ∥⃗v
This eliminates degrees of freedom orthogonal to platform-incentive directions.

Appendix K
LLMs as Low-Curvature Semantic
Surfaces
Semantic curvature is defined as:
K = det
 ∇2Φ

Human discourse exhibits mixed curvature (K > 0 generative regions, K < 0 exploratory
regions).
LLMs exhibit:
KLLM ≈0
indicating flat generativity: high-volume continuation, low semantic acceleration.
The key pathology:
• High token entropy
• Low agency entropy
• Minimal effective curvature
Thus:
LLM output ≡semantic foam without gradient
25

Appendix L
Ethical Gradient Flow and Legal
Counterforces
Healthy systems preserve scalar variance by:
d
dt
Z
S dV > 0
Legal interventions act as boundary constraints:
⃗v · ˆn|harm boundary = 0
indicating agency flow is prevented from entering zones of cognitive damage.
Effective jurisprudence increases curvature diversity:
d
dt⟨K2⟩> 0
which restores ethical degrees of freedom.

Appendix M
Criticality of Predictive Control
Societies fall into 3 phases:
Phase
Field Structure
Result
I. Open Field
High ∇Φ, low ∇S
Innovation
II. Managed Field
∇Φ ≈∇S
Nudging economy
III. Captured Field
∇S ≫∇Φ
Algorithmic authoritarianism
Transition point when:
∇S
∇Φ > 1.2 →1.5
27

Appendix N
Restoring Plenum Coherence
Three restoration operators:
Diversification :
∇2Φ →+
(N.1)
Decentralization :
∇· ⃗v →0
(N.2)
Re-entropization :
S →S + ϵ
(N.3)
A resilient civilization maximizes:
L =
Z  |∇Φ|2 −|∇· ⃗v|2 + αS

dV

Appendix P
Glossary of RSVP Terms
• Scalar Field Φ: Freedom of cognitive possibility
• Vector Field ⃗v: Agency and information flow
• Entropy S: Predictability and compression
• Curvature K: Meaning generation potential
• Vorticity Ω: Looping ideological reinforcement
• Monopole: Centralized control of semantic vector flow

Appendix Q
Concluding Field Law
Cognition survives where curvature flows; control arises where curvature collapses.
(Q.1)
A civilization that preserves freedom is one that maximizes divergence of sense-making
trajectories rather than predicting their endpoints.
Final Appendix Statement
> Collapse is not the loss of freedom. > Collapse is the loss of the mathematical
preconditions for freedom.
Freedom does not disappear when choices vanish — it disappears when the space
in which choices are constructed loses curvature [9].
