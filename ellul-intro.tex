\begin{abstract}
Jacques Ellul's \textit{The Technological Society} (1964) presents Technique not as a collection of machines or policies, but as a total ordering operator over the entirety of social space. This operator enforces a preference relation defined by the maximization of efficiency, equivalently the minimization of friction, ambiguity, irreproducibility, and unstandardized context. Technique is not selected by deliberate human choice; rather, it selects organizational schemas by out-competing alternatives across all articulable domains. We formalize Ellul's six structural properties as axioms and derive the Spherepop calculus, showing how the Playcosm's single-shard, privilege-gated simulations instantiate pop regimes. The analysis bridges Ellul's flattening transformations to shallow gamification's non-expanding shards, motivating anti-admissibility via prefigurative affordances.

\section{The Technological Society as a Pop-Optimizing Regime}

Jacques Ellul's \textit{The Technological Society} (1964) presents Technique not as a collection of machines or policies, but as a total ordering operator over the entirety of social space. This operator enforces a preference relation defined by the maximization of efficiency, equivalently the minimization of friction, ambiguity, irreproducibility, and unstandardized context. Technique is not selected by deliberate human choice; rather, it selects organizational schemas by out-competing alternatives across all articulable domains.

Ellul identifies five structural properties that render Technique a universal attractor, which we formalize as axioms in the Spherepop calculus:

\begin{observation}[Autonomy]
Technique evolves according to its internal logic, independent of human intention.
\end{observation}

\begin{observation}[Unity and Universality]
Discrete techniques interlock into a single, interoperable system that extends to every domain susceptible to measurement, rationalization, or optimization.
\end{observation}

\begin{observation}[Automatic Selection]
The most efficient technique eliminates competitors through inherent competitive advantage, not deliberate choice.
\end{observation}

\begin{observation}[Flattening]
Technique translates heterogeneous interiors into standardized interfaces; semantic density is discarded as unmergeable residue.
\end{observation}

\begin{observation}[Irreversibility]
Inefficiencies, once displaced, cannot be reintroduced without systemic collapse.
\end{observation}

\begin{observation}[Closure without Agency]
The system defines its own evaluation criteria, applies them universally, and excludes non-interoperable alternatives from viability. No central actor directs the process; local optimizations aggregate into global coordination.
\end{observation}

These properties prefigure the Spherepop calculus: a regime that systematically rewards merge operations reducing boundary entropy while penalizing unmergeable internal structures.

\section{Technique as Flattening, Compression, and Semantic Dropout}

Technique does not expand in the manner of imperial growth; it flattens heterogeneous domains into a uniform, interoperable substrate. Only formally comparable properties persist post-transformation. Table~\ref{tab:flattening} illustrates this compressive action across domains.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l l}
\toprule
Domain Before Technique & Domain After Technique \\
\midrule
Medicine as care & Medicine as protocol \\
Education as formation & Education as credentialing \\
Law as judgment & Law as procedure \\
War as ideology & War as logistics \\
Work as craft & Work as process optimization \\
Community as relational & Community as network graph \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Flattening transformations under Technique.}
\label{tab:flattening}
\end{table}

In each instance, internal semantic density yields to external interface consistency. What endures is not intrinsic meaning but mergeability. Technique is thus compressive: it discards semantic residue not through prohibition, but through structural irrelevance in optimization criteria.

Human interiors—moral arguments, sacred boundaries, craft lineages, apprenticeships—fail not due to explicit opposition, but because they lack representation in efficiency metrics. Decision criteria shift from human deliberation to algorithmic optimization, rendering prior values inexpressible without competitive disadvantage.

Technique propagates without central agency: local optimizations aggregate into global coordination. No actor directs the process; each participant advances it inadvertently. Resistance, when articulated technically (e.g., via laws or optimized dissent), accelerates incorporation.

Efficiency functions as selection pressure rather than explicit goal. Inefficient forms do not persist because they are undesired, but because they cannot coexist in the shared environment. The system closes by defining its own evaluation criteria, applying them universally, and excluding non-interoperable alternatives from viability.

Freedom, in Ellul's analysis, is unexpressed due to ontological mismatch: it possesses no interface, metric, or selective edge within the regime. The central unresolved question is whether this closure assumes an exhaustive merge algebra—specifically, that all feasible pops are flattening and efficiency-maximizing.

\section{The Playcosm Bridge: Privilege Gates as Pop Regimes}

The Playcosm manuscript (Anonymous, 2025) conceptualizes play—Barbie dolls, toy cars, \textit{Age of Empires}—as simulations within a single-shard institutional ecosystem, stratified by privilege gates. This framework maps directly to Spherepop:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single-shard ecosystem} $\leftrightarrow$ Collection of spheres \( \mathcal{S} \)
    \item \textbf{Privilege gates} $\leftrightarrow$ Adjacency thresholds in pop regime
    \item \textbf{Stratified simulations} $\leftrightarrow$ Flattened boundary interfaces
    \item \textbf{Shallow gamification} $\leftrightarrow$ Compressive pop with high \( \lambda \)
    \item \textbf{Prefigurative affordances} $\leftrightarrow$ Anti-admissible spheres with ritual/cryptographic resistance
\end{itemize}

Privilege gates function as access modifiers in the pop cost function:
\[
\text{adj}(S_i, S_j) \iff \text{privilege}(player) \geq g_{ij},
\]
where \( g_{ij} \) is the gate threshold. High-privilege players access \texttt{designRoad()}; low-privilege are restricted to \texttt{navigateRoad()}.

Shallow gamification instantiates static metrics (points, badges) without meta-renegotiation, producing non-expanding shards. This is compressive pop with high \( \lambda \), penalizing boundary entropy and pruning institutional function.

Pre-compilable affordances (toy gliders simulating flight) are ritual-cryptographic resistances:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ritual}: Sequential, embodied gestures with path dependence \( \delta > 0 \).
    \item \textbf{Cryptographic}: Tacit knowledge as high-entropy secret \( h \gg 0 \).
\end{itemize}

\section{Natural Bridge to the Math}

The pre-mathematical conclusions are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Technological Society is not a political condition but a merge regime.
    \item It absorbs spheres that can be flattened into efficient interfaces.
    \item What it cannot flatten, it leaves semantically intact but socially irrelevant.
    \item Resistance must therefore make spheres unmergeable, not merely inefficient.
    \item The question becomes what conditions guarantee merge failure?
\end{enumerate}

This naturally yields the mathematical objective:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Identify sufficient conditions under which a sphere cannot be pop-assimilated, even by resource-bounded adversaries operating in the dominant regime.}
\end{quote}

Which is exactly the anti-admissibility theorem.
