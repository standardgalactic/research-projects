# spherepop.safety - Type soundness statement (informal)

Theorem (Type + Entropy Safety):
If ⊢ P : Program and P reduces to value V via a sequence of well-typed transitions,
then:
  (1) No step in the reduction violates a sphere's declared entropy budget.
  (2) No well-typed term gets stuck: either it is a value or it can take a step.

Proof sketch: standard progress + preservation. Preservation uses the typing rules and
budget invariants; progress uses canonical forms and the availability of applicable policies
subject to budget.
