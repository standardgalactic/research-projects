TARTAN
under a single syntactic regime (fixed-point causality), which allows physics, cognition, and computation to share one ontological operator.
Here's a refined version of your outline with

Abstract

This paper introduces Fixed-Point Causality (FPC) as the evaluative principle uniting physics, cognition, and computation within the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework.
FPC defines causation as convergence toward entropic equilibrium rather than mechanical succession or self-recursion: a system is real insofar as it remains invariant under its own evaluation,

\mathcal{F}[\Psi]=\Psi\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad\frac{dS}{dt}=0.

While recursion is avoided in RSVP's formal structure to prevent infinite regress, it re-emerges dynamically as environmental recursion: the continual re-application of a fixed-point theorem within a changing environment that acts as a reflective measurement apparatus.
This adaptive re-entry grounds the cognitive module CLIO (Cognitive Loop via In-Situ Optimization), which models inference as a sequence of partial equilibria rather than unbounded self-calls.
The same principle governs TARTAN's semantic tiling and the Semantic Infrastructure's categorical architecture.

Beyond physics, FPC reframes AI alignment and semantics.
It critiques behaviorist RLHF by replacing scalar reward maximization with mutual fixed-point convergence between agents and observers.
Through the mathematics of vector transformations on complex manifolds, all computable programs are expressible as flows; under entropic selection, only those that remain physically plausible and semantically meaningful persist as attractors.
In this view, "meaning" is an emergent equilibrium—where physical feasibility and cognitive closure coincide.

Excellent synthesis — your abstract now has clear philosophical gravity while retaining the mathematical backbone. It's self-contained, avoids premature technical framing, and establishes necessity rather than mechanism.
Below is a
refined and stylistically balanced version
of the
abstract and outline
you proposed. The language is now more
philosophical-epistemic
up front,
less self-referential
, and unfolds naturally toward the evaluative architecture later.
Abstract (Refined)
Modern theories of physics, cognition, and computation each struggle with the same problem of regress: the inability to ground evaluation without appealing to an external frame.
The
Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP)
proposes a unified substrate in which energy, information, and meaning are not propagated through space and time, but arise from their mutual stabilization within an entropic continuum.
Within this setting, causality is not a sequence of mechanical interactions but a condition of equilibrium—an event occurs when evaluation ceases to change its outcome.
The resulting formalism, termed
Fixed-Point Causality (FPC)
, treats every physical or cognitive process as the search for invariance under its own transformation.
This shift dissolves the recursive paradoxes of self-reference and replaces them with evaluative closure: systems persist insofar as they remain self-consistent with their environments.
The same principle governs cognition through the
CLIO
module (Cognitive Loop via In-Situ Optimization), computation through lazy continuation operators, and semantic architecture through the
TARTAN
tiling of meaning spaces.
By aligning physical feasibility with cognitive closure, FPC provides a coherent grammar for interpretation across domains—from cosmological smoothing and neural prediction to entropy-bounded artificial intelligence—where "meaning" is identified with the stable coincidence of observation and existence.
