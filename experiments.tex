\section{Empirical Plan and Benchmarks}
\label{sec:experiments}

We propose microbenchmarks, case studies, ablations, and a user study.

\subsection{Microbenchmarks}
Measure pop latency for representative rules (TTS, summarization), merge time vs sphere size, closure overhead for varying modality counts.

\subsection{Case Studies}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Collaborative theorem development: integrate with Lean/Coq to manage proof fragments as spheres.
  \item Multimodal tutorial authoring: text+audio+code spheres evaluating closure quality.
  \item Adversarial injection resilience: simulate attackers that propose high-entropy merges.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Metrics}
Entropy evolution, modality completeness, user-rated semantic coherence, mediator search depth, and crystal economics behavior.
