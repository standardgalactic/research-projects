- `lean/` — Lean theorem proving workspace (stubs).
- `docs/` — design docs, roadmap, diagrams.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — basic CI to run unit tests and linting.
- `Makefile` — targets to build LaTeX, run tests, create package.
- `roadmap.md` — Stage 3 roadmap and prioritized tasks.

This archive was generated programmatically for the user. Replace placeholders with full drafts and implementations.
