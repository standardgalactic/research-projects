Fixed-Point Causality: Physics,
Consciousness, and Computation
in the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum
Flyxion
November 2025
Abstract
Modern theories of physics, cognition, and computation face a common im-
passe: evaluation appears to require an external frame. The Relativistic Scalar-
Vector Plenum (RSVP) treats energy, information, and meaning as co-evolving
fields whose stability—rather than motion through a background—constitutes
reality. Within this setting, causality is not a chain of prior events but a condi-
tion of equilibrium: an event occurs when further evaluation no longer alters its
outcome. We formalize this as Fixed-Point Causality (FPC): processes persist
insofar as they are invariant under their own transformation. FPC links (i) a
physical layer, where scalar potential Φ, vector flow v, and entropy 𝑆mutually
relax; (ii) a cognitive layer (CLIO), where predictive inference halts when ex-
pected and observed information coincide; and (iii) a computational-semantic
layer (TARTAN), where lazy continuation and categorical tiling converge on
idempotent meanings. Meaning is identified with the stable coincidence of ob-
servation and existence, summarized by the invariant: 𝐹[Ψ] = Ψ ⇔

Preface / Motivation
RSVP arose from dissatisfaction with expansion cosmologies and recursive theories of
mind, both of which rely on ungrounded externalities. RSVP replaces these with a
single plenum whose scalar potential Φ, vector flux v, and entropy 𝑆seek fixed points
of mutual consistency. The guiding thesis is that stability—not kinematics—grounds
existence, and that evaluative closure is the universal halting principle across physics,
cognition, and computation.́2˘

Introduction
Historical Context: from expansion and representation to eval-
uation
Thermodynamic derivations of geometry (e.g., Jacobson; Verlinde) suggest curvature
may encode information flow; predictive processing and active inference frame cogni-
tion as free-energy minimization; computation exhibits regress in recursion without
intrinsic halting. RSVP absorbs these crises into a thermodynamic ontology: entropy
replaces expansion, invariance replaces recursion.́3˘
From Recursion to Continuation: the grammar of closure
Recursion is syntactic; continuation is semantic. We elevate the fixed-point criterion
𝐹[Ψ] = Ψ
⟺
̇𝑆= 0,
(1)
as universal halting: an "event" is local attainment of informational equilibrium rather
than a tick in external time.́4˘
Outline and Contributions
We formalize FPC, derive RSVP field equations and their variational form, articulate
methodological shifts (environmental recursion), define CLIO as cognitive fixed-point
search, reframe computation as energetic relaxation, develop TARTAN as entropic
semantic tiling, and expose a cognitive-physical isomorphism.́5˘
Fixed-Point Causality (FPC)
Definition: causality as invariance under evaluation
Causality is persistence under self-transformation. With global evaluative state Ψ =
(Φ, v, 𝑆), causal completion occurs when
𝐹[Ψ] = Ψ
⟺
̇𝑆= 0,
(2)
so that the entropy gradient vanishes. Being is invariance under evaluation.́6˘

Lazy continuation and proximal stationarity
Introduce a lazy continuation operator:
Ψ𝑡+1 = Λ(Ψ𝑡),
Ψ∗= Λ(Ψ∗).
(3)
A proximal realization:
Ψ𝑡+1 = 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑥𝜏ℒ(Ψ𝑡) ∶= 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛
Ψ′ [ℒ(Ψ′) + 1
2𝜏‖Ψ′ −Ψ𝑡‖2],
(4)
identifies ∇ℒ(Ψ∗) = 0 at equilibrium, unifying variational stationarity and evaluative
closure.́7˘
Ontological and epistemic reading
Ontology: substance →stability. Epistemology: representation →evaluation. Truth
becomes idempotence under 𝐹.́8˘

Remarks on computation and undecidability
Classical undecidability is syntactic; FPC provides a physical notion of halting (
̇𝑆→
0 ) as sufficiency for real evaluators, without contradicting Turing results.́10˘

The RSVP Field Theory under Fixed-Point Causal-
ity
Motivation and structure of the plenum
The plenum is a continuous evaluative medium; geometry and phenomenology emerge
when evaluation halts locally. Ψ = (Φ, v, 𝑆) encodes a closed triadic relaxation.́11˘
Governing equations
At macroscales:
𝜕𝑡Φ = −∇⋅(Φv) + 𝜉Φ(𝑡),
(5)
𝜕𝑡v = −∇𝑆−Φ ∇× v + 𝜉v(𝑡),
(6)
𝜕𝑡𝑆= −∇⋅(𝑆v) + 𝜅∇2𝑆+ 𝜉𝑆(𝑡),
(7)
with noise 𝜉for unresolved microstructure and diffusion 𝜅. In equilibrium, time deriva-
tives vanish, yielding fixed-point constraints.́12˘
Schematic Scalar-Vector Field

𝑆transport. (Grayscale only.)
Variational formulation
With Lagrangian density
ℒ(Φ, v, 𝑆, 𝜕𝜇Φ, 𝜕𝜇v) = 1
2(𝜕𝜇Φ)2 + 1
2‖∇× v‖2 −𝑉(Φ, v, 𝑆),
(8)

stationarity 𝛿𝐴/𝛿Ψ = 0 agrees with (??)-(??) when 𝜕𝑉/𝜕Φ = ∇⋅(Φv) and 𝜕𝑉/𝜕v =
∇𝑆. Thus variational and evaluative halting coincide.́13˘
Entropic potential and gauge invariance
𝑆↦𝑆+ 𝑐(𝑡) leaves ∇𝑆invariant; only differences drive evolution. Continuity:
𝜕𝑡𝑆+ ∇⋅(𝑆v) = 0,
(9)
expresses informational flux conservation.́14˘
Boundary conditions and the observer as term
For 𝜔⊂Ω,
𝑑
𝑑𝑡∫
𝜔
𝑆𝑑3𝑥= −∮
𝜕𝜔
𝑆v ⋅𝑑A,
(10)
so measurement is flux across an interface: observers act as boundary terms that
stabilize what they measure.́15˘
Fixed points as spacetime geometry
At equilibrium, entropy curvature encodes geometry; a metric surrogate arises via field
gradients, e.g.
𝑔𝜇𝜈∝𝜕𝜇Φ𝜕𝜈Φ,
(11)
linking inertial regions (low entropy curvature) to flatness and high curvature to
wells.́16˘
Numerical verification and relaxation simulation
On a lattice with (Φ𝑖, v𝑖, 𝑆𝑖):
Φ𝑡+1
𝑖
= Φ𝑡
𝑖−𝜂Φ ∇⋅(Φv)𝑖+ 𝜉Φ,𝑖,
(12)
v𝑡+1

𝑖−𝜂𝑣(∇𝑆)𝑖+ 𝜉v,𝑖,
(13)
𝑆𝑡+1
𝑖
= 𝑆𝑡
𝑖−𝜂𝑆∇⋅(𝑆v)𝑖+ 𝜉𝑆,𝑖,
(14)
iterated until ⟨‖∇𝑆‖2⟩< 𝜀. Simulations (e.g., 323) exhibit exponential convergence
and filamentary coherence without invoking expansion.́17˘

Interpretation
Entropic gravity analogies extend: curvature as resistance to informational disequilib-
rium; 𝛿𝑄= 𝑇𝑑𝑆mirrors vanishing
̇𝑆at completion. Energy-momentum conservation
expresses invariance of total evaluative content.́18˘
Origins and Methodological Notes
Rejection of explicit recursion
Explicit recursion smuggles regress: it requires external termination. FPC replaces it
with lazy continuation: evaluate only while disequilibrium persists.́19˘
Environmental recursion and reflective measurement
Nature re-enters its own evaluation through feedback:
Ψ𝑡+1 = 𝐹𝑡[Ψ𝑡],
ℰ𝑡+1 = 𝑅[ℰ𝑡, Ψ𝑡+1],
(15)
seeking a joint fixed point (Ψ∗, ℰ∗).́20˘
Measurement as evaluative closure
With internal expectation
̂Ψ:
Ψ𝑡+1 = 𝑀[Ψ𝑡],
̂Ψ𝑡+1 =
̂Ψ𝑡+ 𝛼(Ψ𝑡+1 −
̂Ψ𝑡),
(16)
closure occurs when Ψ𝑡+1 =
̂Ψ𝑡+1.́21˘
Connection to CLIO and implications
CLIO implements local fixed-point search; models halt when entropy gradients vanish.
Methodologically: halting as sufficiency; evaluation as energy minimization; recursion
as emergent feedback; stability over exactness.́22˘

CLIO: Cognitive Implementation of FPC
Definition of the CLIO functor
Each agent is a localized evaluator operating on beliefs 𝑐∈𝒞:
CLIO ∶𝒞→𝒞,
𝑐∗= CLIO(𝑐∗),
(17)
with functorial update consistency (composition respects order).́23˘

only).
Variational formulation: free-energy minimization
With joint 𝑝(𝑠, 𝑜) and variational 𝑞(𝑠):
ℱ[𝑞] = 𝔼𝑞(𝑠)[𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑞(𝑠) −𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑝(𝑜, 𝑠)] = 𝐷KL(𝑞(𝑠)‖𝑝(𝑠|𝑜)) −𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑝(𝑜),
(18)
and gradient flow
̇𝑞(𝑠) = −𝜂𝛿ℱ
𝛿𝑞(𝑠).
(19)
At equilibrium, 𝛿ℱ/𝛿𝑞= 0, implying
̇𝑆(𝑞) →0 and predictive closure.́24˘
Derivation of the gradient flow and signatures
𝛿ℱ
𝛿𝑞(𝑠) = 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑞(𝑠) −𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑝(𝑜, 𝑠) + 1
⇒
̇𝑆(𝑞) = −𝜂ℱ[𝑞],
(20)
so free-energy decay increases Shannon entropy until convergence; cognitive halting:
ℱ→0,
̇𝑆→0. Predicts entropy-flux equilibration, phase synchrony, and metabolic
efficiency plateaus.́25˘

HYDRA link (multi-agent)
Agents 𝑖with parameters 𝜃𝑖and beliefs 𝑞𝑖(𝑠) minimize individual ℱ𝑖with couplings:
̇𝜃𝑖= −𝜂𝑖𝐺−1
𝑖(𝜃𝑖)∇𝜃𝑖ℱ𝑖(𝜃𝑖) + 𝜆∑
𝑗≠𝑖
(𝜃𝑗−𝜃𝑖),
(21)
yielding mutual corrigibility at ∇ℱ𝑖= 0 for all 𝑖.́26˘
Computational Framing
Computation as evaluative process
Execution is dissipative relaxation in informational space; halting corresponds to
̇𝑆𝑐→
0.́27˘
Lazy evaluation vs recursion
Selective evaluation mirrors physical relaxation: compute only while informative gra-
dients persist; at
̇𝑆→0 halt.́28˘
Fixed-point combinators and convergence
The 𝑌combinator encodes self-application; FPC interprets it as limit of a contraction
sequence 𝑥𝑡+1 = 𝑓(𝑥𝑡) →𝑥∗under Banach conditions, paralleling exponential entropy
decay.́29˘
Entropy as halting and thermodynamic efficiency
Associate entropy 𝑆𝑐(𝑡) = −∑𝑥𝜌𝑡(𝑥) 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝜌𝑡(𝑥);
̇𝑆𝑐→0 marks completion. Define
entropic efficiency 𝜂eval = −𝑑ℱ/𝑑𝑡
̇
𝑄
, stopping when further computation yields heat but
no information (Goodhart-type boundary).́30˘

Platonic invariance becomes immanent: fixed points within the world where evaluation
ceases to alter outcomes.́31˘
Mathematical expression
Group actions 𝑇𝑔with invariants 𝐿𝜉𝐹= 0 parallel
̇𝑆= 0; symmetry and thermody-

Against behaviorist RLHF
External scalar rewards induce pathology off-distribution; FPC replaces reward maxi-
mization with mutual evaluative closure via divergence matching 𝐷KL(𝑝(𝑜|𝜃)‖𝑝(𝑜)) →

TARTAN and Semantic Infrastructure
TARTAN as entropic tiling
Recursive tiling merges cells when |𝑆𝑖−𝑆𝑗| < 𝜀𝑆and ‖Φ𝑖−Φ𝑗‖ < 𝜀Φ, halting when
∑𝑘Var(𝑇𝑘) stops decreasing.́34˘
TARTAN Semantic Tiling

tiling (grayscale only).

Annotated noise and semantic resolution
Residuals 𝑛𝑘= 𝔼[∇𝑆]𝑖∈𝑇𝑘guide refinement; resolution is scale where 𝑛𝑘→0 across
tiles.́35˘
Homotopy colimits and merge operators
Global field via hocolim of local patches; admissible merges satisfy Δ𝑆𝐴,𝐵≤0, defining
an entropy-respecting monoidal structure.́36˘
Categorical FPC and continuation morphisms
Terminal coalgebra (𝜈𝐹, 𝜁) with 𝐹(𝜈𝐹) ≅𝜈𝐹represents coherent tiling. Continua-
tions 𝜅∶𝑇1 →𝑇2 preserve entropy flux: ∇𝑆𝑇2 ∘𝜅= ∇𝑆𝑇1.́37˘
Cognitive-Physical Isomorphism
Unified grammar
Triples Γ = (Φ, v, 𝑆), Ψ = (𝑞, 𝜃, ℱ), Σ = (𝜆, 𝑀, 𝑆sem) obey
𝑑
𝑑𝑡𝑆𝑋= −∇⋅𝐽𝑋,
𝑋∈{Γ, Ψ, Σ},
with equilibrium at
̇𝑆𝑋= 0.́38˘
Observers as boundary conditions
Observers are boundary terms (physics), evidence updates (cognition), and interfaces
(semantics); each enforces continuity across an interface.́39˘
Ethical closure and mutual corrigibility
Alignment arises as multi-agent fixed-point: gradients and conflicts vanish simultane-
ously, yielding corrigible equilibria.́40˘

Implications and Future Work
Theoretical payoffs
Reframes curvature, awareness, and computation as projections of one evaluative gram-
mar.́41˘
Empirical predictions
Cosmological: redshift integrals as smoothing signatures; Cognitive: entropy-convergence
and phase-locking; Computational: entropy-bounded halting and energy plateaus.́42˘
Applications
Safety via entropy-bounded evaluation; interpretable semantic stacks with TARTAN;
distributed corrigibility via HYDRA.́43˘
Conclusion
FPC transforms regress into closure: expansion →evaluation; recursion →stability;
observation →invariance. The unity 𝐹[Ψ] = Ψ ⇔
̇𝑆= 0 organizes physics, cognition,
computation, and ethics under one thermodynamic grammar.́44˘
Appendix A: Derived Geometry of the Coarse-Graining
Functor
Functorial coarse-graining yields a derived stack of configurations with pushforward
interpretations; entropic constraints ensure that gluing minimizes free energy, aligning
with hocolim semantics in TARTAN.́45˘

Appendix B: Numerical Verification of Unistochas-
ticity
We verify stochastic-to-unistochastic consistency of transition maps; entropy-preservation
tests and visualization confirm stability of evaluative channels at fixed point.́46˘
Appendix C: Historical Development of Rotational
Ontology
From Euclid to Minkowski, gauge theory, and quantum phase: rotation as invariance
culminates in RSVP where "rotation" generalizes to evaluation; fixed points encode
conserved structure.́47˘
Appendix D: Mathematical Note on the Fixed-Point

Definition, contraction properties, proximal gradient links ((??)), spectral stability,
