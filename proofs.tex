\section{Extended Proofs}
\label{sec:proofs}

This appendix contains full proofs of the main theorems: type safety, entropy monotonicity, merge coherence, closure idempotence, and finite justification.  We only sketch proofs here and include the full formalization in Appendix~D.

\subsection{Type safety}
Proof by induction on typing derivations.  Preservation uses the additive effect algebra and rule budget constraints.

\subsection{Merge coherence}
We show that if $\sigma_a\oplus\sigma_b=\sigma_m$ and the symmetric case yields $\sigma_m'$, then $d(\sigma_m,\sigma_m')\le 2\epsilon_{\mathrm{merge}}$.  The argument uses triangle inequalities in the metric $d$ combining entropy differences and modality divergences.
