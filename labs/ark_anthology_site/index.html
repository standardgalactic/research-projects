      <h1>The Ark Anthology</h1>
      <p class="tagline">A surreal, retrocosmic series bible based on Giordano Bruno’s lost Ark fable.</p>
    </div>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Series Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <em>The Ark Anthology</em> is a serialized metafable where a single Ark contains an entire closed society:
        donkeys labor on the lower decks, foxes administer the rules, lions reign as symbolic sovereigns, and
        Lorenzo the Llama mediates between them. Giordano Bruno drifts between monastery life, allegorical
        retellings, and dreamlike journeys through the Ark’s geometry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across twelve episodes, rebellion fails, bureaucracy mutates, decks strain, and the Ark’s world-shape
        cracks open to reveal a cosmos of infinite Arks. By the finale, hierarchy itself is understood as a
        geometric constraint: the Ark’s topology, not just its politics, determines which rebellions can succeed.

      <h2>Core Themes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hierarchy as geometry</strong> – class is enforced by curvature, not just habit.</li>
        <li><strong>Mediation as complicity</strong> – Lorenzo’s journey from kind mediator to captured middle manager.</li>
        <li><strong>Rebellion without exit</strong> – why justified uprisings keep collapsing back into routine.</li>
        <li><strong>Closed-world cosmology</strong> – the Ark believes itself to be the universe.</li>
        <li><strong>Narrative as enforcement</strong> – trial-plays and gospels policing what can be imagined.</li>
        <li><strong>Imagination as breach</strong> – Bruno’s visions of other Arks finally tear the ceiling open.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>World Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        The Ark is a socio-narrative manifold with layered decks:
        donkeys below, foxes in the administrative middle, lions above as ceremonial rulers, and Noah as the
        exhausted architect pinned between divine blueprints and structural failure. Beneath everything lies
        <strong>Deck 0</strong>, a hidden layer where suppressed tensions are drained away to keep the visible world calm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In RSVP language, the Ark’s scalar potential, flow, and entropy fields constrain motion:
        some paths (obedience, resignation) are geodesics; others (revolt, solidarity) slam into regions of high curvature
        and collapse. The series makes that geometry felt as warped staircases, impossible descents, and dreams that
        spill outside the hull.
