      <h2>Monks (Human World)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brother Tommaso</strong> – Bruno’s closest friend. A cheerful skeptic who laughs easily, obeys reluctantly, and later becomes the informal keeper of Bruno’s stories.</li>
        <li><strong>Brother Lorenzo</strong> – The model monk, gentle and diplomatic. His dream-self becomes Lorenzo the Llama, embodying the middle stratum of the Ark.</li>
        <li><strong>Brother Daniele</strong> – An anxious idealist who loves rules but loves Bruno more. Torn between safety and truth, he is almost always the last to leave forbidden gatherings.</li>
        <li><strong>Brother Agnolo</strong> – Overly devout novice, takes rules literally. Oscillates between admiration and fear of Bruno; maps onto fox-like boundary-policing in allegories.</li>
        <li><strong>Brother Matteo</strong> – Nearly silent; observes everything. Later revealed to have memorized more of Bruno’s work than anyone suspected.</li>
        <li><strong>Brother Crispin (The Librarian)</strong> – Guardian of the monastery’s books, suspicious but secretly impressed by Bruno. Ark counterpart: Pica the fox archivist.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ark Animals</h2>
      <h3>Lorenzo the Llama</h3>
      <p>
        The core mediator figure: stands between donkeys and foxes/lions, translating grievances into procedure.
        Over time he becomes a vector field embodying the Ark’s middle stratum—first softening curvature, then captured by
        it, and finally transcending the Ark altogether.
      </p>

      <h3>Donkey Chorus</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Grano</strong> – Elder storyteller, cynical but loyal. First to recognize the allegorical power of Bruno’s tales.</li>
        <li><strong>Anice</strong> – Young idealist who eventually sees the horizon beyond the Ark in Episode 11.</li>
        <li><strong>Bitto</strong> – Overworked, exhausted, and unintentionally funny; his complaints form the backbone of the Donkey Gospel.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Fox Delegation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vulpes</strong> – Lead fox and master of procedural delay. Architect of the administrative coup in “Foxes at the Helm.”</li>
        <li><strong>Saffron</strong> – A fox sympathetic to the donkeys but trapped by loyalty and fear of losing status.</li>
        <li><strong>Pica</strong> – Archivist fox; animal-world counterpart to Brother Crispin. Oversees confiscated texts and burns the Donkey Gospel.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aurus</strong> – Primary lion ruler, increasingly weary of his ceremonial role. Attempts to descend but is blocked by curvature in “The Lion’s Dream.”</li>
        <li><strong>Regulus</strong> – A more introspective lion, aware of the hollowness of power but unable to renounce it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Other Ark Figures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Noah</strong> – Conflicted architect, caught between divine blueprints and structural impossibility. Appears most strongly in “Noah’s Revision.”</li>
        <li><strong>Deck 0 Entities</strong> – Silent, uncanny beings in the unseen layer that absorb suppressed rebellion and sorrow.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Cosmic & Metaphysical Figures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bureau Archivists</strong> – Celestial functionaries in “The Bureau of Arks” who treat world-geometry as paperwork.</li>
        <li><strong>The Horizon</strong> – A quasi-personified boundary in Episode 11, representing the edge of the Ark manifold.</li>
        <li><strong>Trial Judges</strong> – Lion-fox hybrids in the finale, performing Bruno’s condemnation in an endlessly looping play.</li>
      </ul>
