      <h2>Season 2 — The Open Worlds</h2>
      <p>
        After the Ark dissolves into starlight, the camera (and Bruno’s perspective) drifts to the other Arks glimpsed in
        Episode 3. Each episode follows a different Ark with a distinct geometry:
        egalitarian failures, spiral-world rebellions, post-hierarchical experiments that threaten to collapse.
        The core question: if hierarchy is a geometry problem, what does a stable non-hierarchical manifold look like?

      <h2>Season 3 — The Llama Returns</h2>
      <p>
        Lorenzo reappears as a fully-fledged field-avatar, no longer bound to a single Ark. He moves across worlds as a
        kind of cosmic mediator, helping (or failing to help) new civilizations design their own deck structures.
        Episodes track his attempts to avoid repeating the capture he experienced in Season 1.
      </p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Season 4 — Trial at the Center of the Manifold</h2>
      <p>
        Bruno is summoned (or dream-summoned) to a tribunal at the center of the Ark manifold, where representatives of
        many worlds debate whether multiplicity itself is heresy. The season blends cosmic courtroom drama with RSVP
        field theory: Bruno must argue that no single Ark, no single geometry, can be final.

      <h2>Other Possible Extensions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ark Anthology: Stories from Deck 0</strong> – a darker anthology diving deeper into the unseen layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Bruno &amp; The Bureau</strong> – a bureaucratic spin-off focused on the cosmic office where Arks are designed.</li>
        <li><strong>The Donkey Gospel (Standalone Film)</strong> – the rise and suppression of the lower-deck scripture, framed as a tragic musical.</li>
