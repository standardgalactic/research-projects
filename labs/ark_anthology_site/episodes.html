      <h1>Episode Guide</h1>
      <p class="tagline">Twelve episodes charting the rise, capture, and collapse of a closed Ark world.</p>
    </div>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <h2>Episode 1 – The Rebellion Deck</h2>
        <p>Donkeys organize a first serious revolt against lower-deck conditions. Foxes stall them with procedures, Lorenzo attempts mediation, and the Ark’s curvature itself blocks their march. The rebellion collapses without a single explicit command to stop it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Episode 2 – Llama: Middle Manager of Heaven</h2>
        <p>Lorenzo is promoted to mid-deck liaison. Intent on doing good, he quickly discovers every compromise he makes tightens the structure around the donkeys. By the end, he realizes he has become an instrument of continuity, not change.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Episode 3 – Ark of Infinite Worlds</h2>
        <p>Bruno dreams of a cosmos of alternate Arks, each with different hierarchies and fates. He cannot step onto any of them; dimensional curvature forces him back. He wakes knowing his Ark is not unique, only trapped.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Episode 4 – The Donkey Gospel</h2>
        <p>The donkeys write their own scripture: stories, jokes, laments. Foxes confiscate the scrolls; lions declare them dangerous. Most are burned, but Lorenzo and Bruno preserve fragments in memory and body.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Episode 5 – Foxes at the Helm</h2>
        <p>Foxes outmaneuver the lions in a quiet coup and install a “modernized” regime. Donkey conditions improve slightly, but the overall geometry is unchanged. The new rulers become as paranoid and brittle as the old ones.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Episode 6 – The Lion’s Dream</h2>
        <p>Aurus, a lion, confides that he wants to descend and meet the donkeys as equals. The Ark itself resists: stairs elongate, doors vanish. His role proves to be a prison, and he returns to his throne in despair.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Episode 7 – Noah’s Revision</h2>
        <p>Noah attempts to alter the divine blueprints to allow more justice. Small changes destabilize the hull. A final attempt to merge decks nearly breaks the Ark in half. Foxes secretly restore the old design; Noah vanishes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Episode 8 – The Bureau of Arks</h2>
        <p>Lorenzo finds himself in a surreal celestial office where Arks are just case files. His complaints about his world trigger bureaucratic recursion and eventual meltdown. He is hurled back to the Ark, now half field, half animal.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Episode 9 – Deck 0: The Unseen Layer</h2>
        <p>Bruno falls into Deck 0, an unseen layer where silent beings digest revolt, fear, and sorrow. He learns that the Ark’s apparent stability depends on this drain. Returning with this knowledge, he becomes dangerous to the structure.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Episode 10 – Llama Ascendant</h2>
        <p>Lorenzo discovers he can move freely between decks, becoming a mediator-field that reshapes curvature. His efforts to flatten the Ark tear at its foundations. He ultimately abandons form, leaving the structure to collapse.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Episode 11 – The Donkey Who Saw the Horizon</h2>
        <p>Anice, a young donkey, glimpses a luminous horizon beyond the Ark. This vision spreads, tipping the ship and revealing a void of stars around them. The world’s edges blur; the Ark is ending.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Episode 12 – Bruno’s Trial, Performed by Animals</h2>
        <p>The animals stage Bruno’s heresy trial as a play. Bruno refuses his assigned role, breaking the script. The Ark’s geometry collapses, its ceiling tears open to reveal infinite worlds, and the Ark dissolves into starlight.</p>
