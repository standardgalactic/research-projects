# RSVP Labs – Retro Monitor Experiments

This mini-site contains a set of small interactive JavaScript labs for exploring toy dynamics inspired by the
Relativistic Scalar–Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, using a green-on-black CRT aesthetic.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Lab hub and description
- `curvature.html` – Lab 01: 2D curvature field / gradient descent particle
- `mediator.html` – Lab 02: 1D lower–mediator–upper chain
- `entropy.html` – Lab 03: entropy sink / leak toy
- `attractors.html` – Lab 04: double-well attractor switching
- `css/retro.css` – shared retro styling
- `js/common.js` – navigation + fade
- `js/curvature.js`, `js/mediator.js`, `js/entropy.js`, `js/attractors.js` – per-lab logic

Open `index.html` in a browser and use the nav on the left to jump between labs.
