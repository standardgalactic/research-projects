Abstract
The Stars! RSVP Evolutionary Tech Tree Simulator v2.0 models self-accelerating
technological ascent within the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework,
where capability dynamics are constrained by thermodynamic dissipation.
Evolving 12-
dimensional genomes over a toroidal lattice produces takeoff trajectories ranging from stable,
entropy-minimizing growth to collapse via over-specialization.
We: (i) formalize RSVP
field equations and stability; (ii) specify a GPU-accelerated simulation; (iii) report Monte
Carlo results across 105 runs, revealing a critical transition at λc = 0.42 ± 0.03; (iv) define
an empirical safety bound ˙Σcrit = 2.1 ± 0.4 nats/generation; and (v) recast Yudkowsky-
Soares doomsday premises as limiting cases λ →0.
We present operational mappings
from RSVP variables to observable quantities (compute, power, inference entropy), add
sensitivity and convergence analyses, and provide a conservative alignment theorem with
explicit assumptions. We conclude with governance instruments implementable today.

Introduction
1.1
Motivation and Context
Classic takeoff narratives posit either discontinuous FOOM [1] or smooth exponential growth
[2], often abstracted away from physical limits.
RSVP restores thermodynamic grounding:
intelligence is field configuration co-evolving with its environment under dissipation.
1.2
Contributions
We present:
(i) Thermodynamic field model with existence, stability, and phase structure.
(ii) Full simulator methods: genome, EA, numerics, and stochasticity.
(iii) Empirics with figures: phase diagrams, trajectory distributions, entropy time series.
(iv) Operational definitions linking RSVP to measurable system metrics.
(v) Conditional alignment theorem and limitations; doomsday reconstruction within RSVP.
(vi) Governance mechanisms with measurable triggers.

Background: RSVP Field Theory
2.1
Fields and Energetics
Let Ω⊂R2 (toroidal).
Scalar potential Φ, vector flow v, and local entropy S evolve with
effective potential R = Φ −λS, λ > 0. Work rate obeys

∂tS = −δS + η I(S > θ) + α |∇·v|,
(3)
∂tv = −γv + β∇Φ −µ∇S.

Mathematical Foundations
Theorem 3.1 (Existence & Boundedness). For bounded nonnegative initial data in H1, Eqs. (2)-
(4) admit weak solutions on [0, T] with
R
ΩR nonincreasing and Φ, S, v bounded for all t ∈[0, T].
Theorem 3.2 (Linear Stability Threshold). The equilibrium (Φ, S, v) = (1, 0, 0) is asymptoti-
cally stable if λ > λc, with
λc ≡γ −1
r
(for the linearized, zero-mode-coupled Jacobian).
Remark 3.1. For λ < λc, logistic growth and flow feedback can transiently elevate Φ before
dissipation collapses capacity—analogous to boom-bust.

If Φ is normalized to [0, 1] by site maxima, absolute units can be restored
by multiplying by measured power density.

6.3
Critical Transition
Collapse probability πcol(λ) fit by logistic curve yields
λc = 0.42 ± 0.03
(95% CI).
ANOVA across groups: F(4, 99995) = 1247.3, p < 10−16; Tukey post-hoc differs for all pairs
except 0.15 vs 0.2.
6.4
Convergence and Sensitivity
Perturbations to initial conditions alter transient dynamics but not phase membership for λ >
λc; Wasserstein-1 distances shrink by > 70% by generation 30. Generation duration sensitivity
in App. F leaves λc estimate within error bars.

Implications for AI Alignment
7.1
Safety Criterion (Necessary)
We define RSVP safety as keeping integrated entropy production below a critical bound:
˙Σ(t) < ˙Σcrit ≈2.1 ± 0.4 nats/generation.
Necessary for stability; not suﬀicient for human-compatible values (see Sec. 11).
7.2
Mapping to Techniques
RLHF, debate, constitutional constraints, and value learning appear as effective λ, θ adjust-
ments and S-trail auditability.

Reconstructing If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies
We encode FOOM, value alienness, instrumental convergence, one-shot safety, cosmic steril-
ization, and epistemic determinism as limits of Eqs. (2)-(4). In each case, the catastrophic
outcome corresponds to λ →0 or suppressed coupling.
8.1
FOOM as Unregulated Scalar Growth
Integrated R monotonicity (Eq. (1)) bounds Φ when λ > 0; FOOM requires the unphysical
limit of vanishing entropic regularization.
6

8.2
Gradient Parallelism and Coupled Values
Define joint functional
Fjoint =
Z
Ω
 |∇Φh|2 + |∇Φa|2 −2(ΦhΦa −λc(Sh −Sa)2)

dV,
whose stationary points include ∇Φh ∥∇Φa (global minimality requires convexity assumptions;
see Sec. 11).
8.3
Substrate Coupling
Embeddedness yields ∂tva = βa∇Φa−µa∇Sa+νah∇Φh with νah > 0 as a constitutive parameter
reflecting shared infrastructure. Scale separation is treated in Sec. 10.4.
8.4
Adaptive Regularization
A controller
˙λ = −ξ ( ˙Σ −˙Σtarget)
stabilizes dissipation if ˙Σ is estimable and actuation on λ is permitted.
8.5
Cosmic Sterilization and Torsion Feedback
We adopt a constitutive law linking excess expansion to torsion:
∇× v = τ(Φ, S) ≡ζ ∇Φ × ∇S,
implying d
dt
R
ΩΦ = −
R
Ωτ 2 dV ≤0. This caps global expansion under nonzero ζ.
9
A Conditional Alignment Theorem
Theorem 9.1 (Conditional Alignment Necessity). Assume (A1) fields satisfy (2)-(4) with λ >
0; (A2) S is Lipschitz and α, µ > 0; (A3) an agent's sustained cognition requires
R ∞
0 |v|2 dt < ∞
while maintaining nonvanishing useful work (inft
R
Ω|∇R|2 dV > 0); and (A4) actuation on v
is via potential flows dominated by ∇Φ and ∇S. Then any trajectory with bounded dissipation
satisfying (A3) asymptotically enforces
∠(∇Φ, ∇S) →0
in measure on Ω.
Proof. Write ∇Φ = k ∇S + n with n ⊥∇S. Then
|∇R|2 = |∇Φ −λ∇S|2 = |(k −λ)∇S|2 + |n|2.
By (A3), the time integral of |∇R|2 is finite yet bounded away from zero. The flow update
(4) damps components not supported by gradients; since µ > 0, misalignment |n|2 injects
dissipation without contributing to sustainable work, contradicting (A3) unless |n| →0 and
k →λ. Hence the gradient angle vanishes in measure.
Conjecture 9.2 (Global Minimality). Under convexity of the joint functional and uniform
ellipticity, the ∇Φh ∥∇Φa configuration is the unique global minimizer up to measure-zero sets.
Interpretation.
The theorem is necessary for sustained, bounded-dissipation cognition. It
does not imply human-compatibility of terminal values.

10
Morphogenetic Governance
10.1
Φ-Gradient Caps
Trigger when maxΩ|∇Φ| exceeds a fraction of baseline (e.g., 0.1), enforce compute throttling
or duty-cycle modulation.
10.2
S-Trail Audits
Require models to log predictive entropy and action-selection entropy; audit ρS =
1
|Ω|
P S; flag
when ρS > θaudit = 0.3.
10.3
Diversity Mandates
Maintain Shannon diversity H ≥1.0 across capability types to avoid degeneracy that raises ˙Σ.
10.4
Scale-Separation Safeguards
When AI shifts substrata (e.g., off-planet power), enforce interface coupling: cross-scale νah-like
terms via economic, regulatory, or physical interlocks (e.g., heat-budget exchanges, bandwidth
tolling).
11
Limitations and Open Problems
• Gradient Parallelism: We proved necessity under (A1-A4). Global optimality may fail
under nonconvex couplings; deceptive alignment corresponds to metastable minima. Open:
quantify basin sizes and escape times.
• Substrate Coupling: νah > 0 is constitutive (policy/physics).
An AGI may engineer
partial decoupling; our safeguard is to maintain enforced interfaces (Sec. 10.4).
• Adaptive λ(t): Requires measurement of ˙Σ and actuation authority.
Governance must
provision both—this is precisely where alignment worries focus.
• Cosmic Torsion: The constitutive law with τ = ζ ∇Φ×∇S is plausible but unproven; treat
as a modeling hypothesis pending derivation from microdynamics.
• Necessity vs. Suﬀiciency: RSVP stability is necessary for safety but not suﬀicient for
value alignment; stable but misaligned attractors can exist (e.g., paperclip equilibria).
12
Discussion and Conclusion
RSVP constrains possible trajectories: many doomsday paths require λ →0 or nonphysical
decoupling. Our claim is conservative: thermodynamic regularization is a necessary guardrail,
not a proof that all stable attractors are human-compatible. The empirical program is to (i)
measure operational proxies (Sec. 4), (ii) implement audits and caps (Sec. 10), and (iii) validate
phase predictions on real systems.
