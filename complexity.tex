\section{Complexity Analysis}
\label{sec:complexity}

We analyze the worst-case and average-case complexity of pop, merge, and closure.

\subsection{Pop complexity}
For a chain $R$ of length $n_r$, assuming each primitive rule executes in $O(C_r)$, $\texttt{pop}$ is $O(n_r\cdot C_r)$.  Practical bounds exploit memoization and idempotence of closures.

\subsection{Merge and mediation complexity}
We show that general mediated reconciliation (finding minimal-entropy transforms) is NP-hard by reduction from subset-sum / partitioning when rules can rearrange discrete combinatorial content.  Under restrictions (bounded branching, limited rule budget), we derive PTIME algorithms and an FPTAS for approximation.

\subsection{Parallelizability}
We present lock-free strategies for independent pops and a distributed quorum protocol for merges, with proofs of eventual consistency under bounded message delay.
