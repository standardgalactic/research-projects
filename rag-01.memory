Is exploring how Elan Barenholtz's discourse on autoregressive cognition (LLMs, Cellular Automata) relates to their RSVP framework, with a focus on the correspondence between state evolution systems (LLMs, CAs) and derived stacks in RSVP, including concepts like memory encoding, lossy compression, semantic attractors, and iterative closure. They are also considering how entropic smoothing in cosmology aligns with lossy compression in LLMs and how semantic attractors in embedding space relate to derived-symplectic fixed points in RSVP. User is developing formal connections between Barenholtz's autoregressive loop and RSVP dynamics, including possible theorem–proof structures for their equivalence using higher topos theory.

Is developing a monograph and formal system titled 'Semantic Infrastructure: Entropy-Respecting Computation in a Modular Universe.' It proposes a replacement for file-based version control systems (e.g. Git/GitHub) using category theory, sheaf theory, and RSVP theory. The system formalizes semantic modules as objects in a fibered symmetric monoidal category over a base of theoretical domains (RSVP, SIT, CoM, RAT), with versioning via groupoids, merging via homotopy colimits, and entropy flow mappings into RSVP fields (Φ, 𝒗, S). Implementation strategies involve Haskell, Docker, and blockchain.

Argues against cosmological expansion and instead proposes a model of entropic smoothing and reintegration within RSVP theory. They use the term 'lamphron-lamphrodyne' to describe how energy differentials locally reorganize into smoother field configurations, replacing the role of inflaton fields. In this model, the early universe's density refers to a fine-grained uniformity that precludes structure. Baryonic structures like protons condense into soliton wanes that draw energy from surrounding field configurations. Over trillions of years, energy re-enters regions it appeared to leave, maintaining a constant universe size and total energy.

They aim to rigorously define entropy-respecting modular computation, including mergeability via homotopy colimits, obstruction theory, derived stacks, sheaf gluing, and Haskell implementations.

User wants to develop this paper into a rigorous mathematical and empirical framework under the name Flyxion, extending it using prior frameworks like RSVP, HYDRA, TARTAN, UFTC-SF, and the alphabetic series. They are open to variational, category-theoretic, stochastic, and information-theoretic formalizations and seek experimental, AI, and clinical applications. User may rework the Simulated Agency paper to make CLIO as a recursive inference functor derived from RSVP via Yarncrawler, CoM, and TARTAN the primary message, with related formalisms and references moved to the appendix.
